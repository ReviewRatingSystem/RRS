In fact, nine times out of ten, I will choose this place over one of the big box stores in a heartbeat. They have a surprisingly large amount of stock, despite their small stature.

The staff is unbelievably helpful and generally quite knowledgeable, offering up suggestions etc. Prices are competitive. And they even have freshly popped pop corn for $0.25 a bag to bolster your energy on the way home to tackle that next project. Other pluses are that parking is never an issue, you will never have to wait in the checkout line for a time period that is greater than the rest of your shopping excursion combined, they don't bug their eyes out at you if it appears that you just went spelunking in your back yard (mud and all), and you won't be accosted by out of work handymen on your way in or out.\n\nIf you are in the need for some home pick-me-ups, give Walt's a try and see if you don't agree that they improve the improvement process.", "business_id": "_uJ3nZSeZjlrUV2ne1L-4Q", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-07-09", "type": "review"}

The last time I was here I did not have a good experience, as my previous rating will clearly show. I honestly didn't think I'd ever return here. Then it was brought to my attention that some Yelpers, well...let's just say they thought I deserved to give the place another chance. So I decided I would.\n\nThe place has honestly made a 180-degree change from when I was last here. I didn't even mention in my last review that the floors were a mess and the paint on the walls was chipping horribly - but fortunately that's all been fixed and a new layer of paint gave the place a totally different look. Various decals are up on the walls now to add some personality to the place, too. Plus the racks were much easier to navigate, and I wasn't constantly tripping around the store. And unlike last time there was music pumping out over the speakers...although - and this is definitely personal taste talking here - I have to be honest, curse words and racial slurs just don't do anything for me, so I can't say I enjoyed everything being played musically during my visit. \n\nAnyway, not only does the store physically have a new look but the items available have also changed; last time I was here it was 50% newer stuff, 50% old stuff. Now I understand why some people were getting mad that I was calling the place a thrift store - since my last visit the store has received and collected far more vintage merch to sell. No wonder it's become so popular. (Granted, I'll still be referring to this shop by what's it classified as right on Yelp itself: Used/Consignment/Vintage.)\n\nThe quality in what I found also skyrocketed from fairly worn and torn since my last visit. I even found some items I wanted to try on this time, and left with one of them - unfortunately as I'm sure fellow shoppers will understand, sometimes the items that fit your personality just don't fit your frame. \n\nSo would I put this store on the same level as some of the 'Burgh's vintage boutiques? No, but I think a comparison of their racks would quickly reveal that they're not meant to be on the same level. Clothes Minded is, after all, a Used/Consignment/Vintage store, and a unique one. It's meeting a specific local demand and it's on its own level - a level that has vintage/used clothes available for used store pricing in a store that has a thrifty feel to it.\n\nIf I could give the place a 3.5 rating, I would - 3.5 accurately sums up my experience after taking the music into account: more than a-ok, not quite enough to get me to want to come back in the near future. But now I will definitely consider stopping in the next time I'm in the area, and with a few more successful shopping trips I may finally be persuaded to join the hardcore fan category. Hopefully that potential and my new rating is enough to get me removed from the \"frumpy idiot\" list! :)", "business_id": "VKIxpoY2iGqsx22IQE36vw", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-07-14", "type": "review"}

There are many great stores and restaurants here and it is an nice, upscale location. There is a lot of greenery and a misting system in the summer. But why the three stars? Well, to understand that, you must first understand how the mall is laid out. In the back there is a large 4 (?) story parking garage which has walkways to Neiman Marcus and anyone can park there for free. In the front of the mall they have a ton, and I mean a ton, of parking spaces as the mall is essentially surrounded by parking on all sides (with the aforementioned parking garage being one of them). However, they have recently started charging for parking in parking lot (i.e. the front). Despite the fact that they never had any shortage of parking, they decided to start charging for parking there anyways. The parking is free for two hours with validation, so I would give Biltmore Fashion 4 stars except for the fact that there new parking system is terribly designed. It is both confusing (to newcomers) and hard to navigate (leading to congestion of through traffic. Also you must pay for parking at kiosks, before you get to your car which is another inconvenience.

I asked a coworker who did body painting and received a quote from her, but there was a question of whether the products she used would be safe for me to try, so I put the thought away.  The next day, I remembered that mall department stores offered makeovers all the time, and then I thought of Sephora's makeover stations that I never tried.  What a perfect time to do so, I thought, so I made the call.  The woman on the phone asked if I had photos of the look I wanted, and I said I'd bring some, and I asked for a time estimate.  She said an hour.  I made an appointment for 4:30p, but as it turned out, I arrived early and was introduced to Amber, who was to be my custom makeup artist.  \n\nAmber was very amiable, conversational, and excited to do something out-of-the-ordinary, which made the whole process of getting a makeover very fun!  I have sensitive skin, as well as food and environmental allergies that keep me from using foundation and many products, so I was nervous about the possibility of negative reactions to any of the products we were going to try, but the only problem I encountered was a mild itch on my nose- not enough for me to want to run to the nearest sink and wash off all the products!  The whole process took about two hours**, and Amber answered all of my questions throughout.  I received many compliments at the Dia de los muertos party I attended, despite the fact that attendees could receive COMPLIMENTARY makeup from an artist present at the party.  (I was even approached by a mother with a young girl at the end of the event who wanted photographs taken with me!)  At least I knew that I was using quality products designed for surgical patients through Amber and Sephora!  (Not to say that the artist there wasn't using quality products, but with party time constraints, I wouldn't have been able to ask her all I needed to know to avoid skin reactions.  All that had their makeup done with her looked terrific!)\n\nI would like to schedule more makeovers at Sephora so that I may learn how to achieve certain looks, as well as try out new products, and I will ask for Amber again, or someone she recommends I try.\n\n*Please note that there is a $50 minimum purchase associated with a custom makeover.\n\n**Amber went above and beyond her duties as a Sephora makeup artist when she assisted in applying tattoo decals I had purchased elsewhere, as well as allowed me to pay for products there at the CM station, rather than have me wait to pay at the cashier.  I had a terrific time!\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sephora-scottsdale?select=lzZbOl2eBlmKOTWqdvF1Bw#lzZbOl2eBlmKOTWqdvF1Bw\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sephora-scottsdale?select=HBeoahPFcVAb4fOWXm_q3A#HBeoahPFcVAb4fOWXm_q3A\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sephora-scottsdale?select=VEWdri3QbWfQTv1ngN8Vbw#VEWdri3QbWfQTv1ngN8Vbw", "business_id": "pdxyZdnwltQXcu-kD5rpXQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-10-24", "type": "review"}

This happened 4 times at least. Neither was able to get the issue resolved. At one point, John From LOWES called the vendor who told him to tell me to check the boxes the doors came in....I'm still amazed that John actually did this. (As though I had not looked).

A non-employee of a security company that works at Walmarts to catch shoplifters told me they are having a lot of trouble Valley wide with customers running off with the hand baskets, so they have stopped buying them at at least some stores.  Ok, but it's still 1 Star for other reasons.) \n\n= = = = = =\n\nSo moving right along, I went out into the area near the entrance & got a wheeled shopping cart, but it was defective.  WHY IS IT THERE?  Why the bad carts culled out before opening time & someone called to come fix or replace them?  Is this any way to run a store?  I think not.\n\nAfter finding a cart that would roll, I went to get my first item, some hair stuff I use and always buy at Walmart.  Rather than neatly organized as at other Walmarts, everything was stocked all willy-nilly, with even the various brands all mixed together.  I finally found the spot where my item stocks, but they were OUT OF IT!  I have an idea...  HAVE WHAT YOU CARRY, IN STOCK!  Was there suddenly a rush on this one obscure item?  I think not.\n\nThen it was over to buy some notepads that I always buy at Wal*Mart.  I eventually found them, in the WRONG BIN, with the WRONG PRICE posted at the display!  Is this ok?  I think not.\n\nI needed an outdoor thermometer.  There was a sign hanging up on an aisle that said \"Thermometers\", but there wasn't a single one to be found within eight feet of the sign.

The client base is surprisingly normal. \n\nThere is a nice selection of cards, for birthdays- females or males- (left side) including a 99 cents section (left side section, not against the wall). There is a seasonal section in the front of the store (cute stuff). There is a nice selection of Yankee Candles. There are a variety of gifts. There is a Disney section of figurines. There is a gift wrap section on the far right side. There is also a section (back middle of the store) for custom made stationery. The clearance section is located in the back right side of the store. The circular cashier station is in the middle of the store. There's all kinds of candy gifts in the this section around the entire perimeter of the cashier station- kinda like what they do at grocery stores- nice marketing ploy. I prefer this one to the Meadows Mall's store since this one is larger. \n\nIf you are a crown rewards member, you will earn points on every purchase.

I was made to feel comfortable, and wasn't hurried at all. The exam was comprehensive and straight-forward. Any and all questions I had were answered and the exam itself didn't take more than a half-hour. I was very pleased with the whole experience. \n\nNow on to the 2nd part of the trip, finding new frames. LensCrafters always has a great selection of frames to offer, and I found a new set with little effort. Once I found the frames, I was taken to fit and calibrate. This process took longer than the exam but I was happy about it because it was obvious that the folks here really care about your comfort and your vision. Luth, the lady who helped me was very nice and also answered any and all questions from me. \n\nWhere this LensCrafters went above and beyond was when I found my lenses had to be special-ordered, because I wear progressives I had resigned myself to buying a set of 'cheaters' to bridge the 2-week gap. When I offhandedly mentioned this to Luth, she told me to wait a moment, then proceeded to go speak with her manager. What they did, free of charge (!!!), was to supply me with 'loaner lenses'! I was stunned at this happy bit of customer service. \n\nI ordered lenses with all the bells and whistles as I work in graphics design, and any edge I can get to pamper my peepers, I take without complaint. The lenses they gave me were basically the no-frills cheaper version of what they offer for sale, but what an incredibly nice gesture for this establishment to go the extra yard for a customer.\n\nThis particular LensCrafters knows how to ensure repeat business, because I will shop for all of my glasses here from now on.", "business_id": "2XFoRMgw9kvUG_ZHm29-OA", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-10-10", "type": "review"}

We stopped in and asked one of the saleswomen in the store, Barbara, about the La Prairie 24 carat gold product.  One of my wisest, oldest, and closet friends who's living the life in London, Davinchi, told me about an interesting experience he had with this particular skin care product which is made in France.  \n\nThe product is beautifully encased in a gold cylindrical container that is shaped like a thick, gold-plated, humanoid penis.  Barbara squirted a small amount of the super serum onto the back of our hands.  The serum was clear and viscous.  There were literally tiny, sparkling flecks of gold flakes suspended in the essence that were clearly visible to the naked eye.  Rubbing the serum into my skin with a circular motion, it took a bit of time for it to dissolve thoroughly and to absorb through the outer skin layer.  It left a slightly tacky finish, a slightly golden tinge on my skin, and an earthy, musky fragrance that reminded me of wild vegetation growing in the rainforest.  \n\nBarbara allowed Karen and me to apply a small amount of the product to our faces.  We applied it to the base of our foreheads, cheeks, and nose.  Barbara promised that within a few hours we would notice a significant improvement in our skin hue and condition.\n\nBefore leaving the COS Bar, I noticed that the 5 inch, penis shaped, gold plated container only contains 1 fluid ounce of product.  And, the price is $570.  \n\nWe walked around the commons for a bit and eventually forgot about the serum on our faces.  But, later that night in my hotel room while brushing my teeth I looked into the mirror at me staring at me and remembered Barbara's promise.  I looked at every detail of my face carefully, every line, ridge, and undulation, searching for improvement.  Everything looked pretty familiar. I sighed. I sighed a heavy sigh of relief.  I guess I wouldn't want to ever be anyone other than me - that's right, me with all my flaws and my imperfect skin.  \n\nI finally noticed that my cheeks seemed to glow in a brighter shade of a golden hue.  But, it was probably because I was happy.\n\nThere's no cosmetic that works better than happiness.", "business_id": "nsi2a3lRj1-w1FmJ2F1kzQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-10-09", "type": "review"}

It's hidden in a corner behind an elevator and it took forever to get through the casino.

Then at checkout  tried to sell me on two 5 pan palettes. For the price of two 5 pan palettes, I could have bought another eyeshadow. Now I have 10 shadows floating around my makeup bag because I have to purchase it online. When I asked when they would receive the palette in store, the manager replied, \"Maybe next week, but who knows?\" I don't understand how you do not have the product in which the whole store is based on.

They are very clearly marked, which is a plus, but at each location there is only one room. That is a family restroom with two toilets, two sinks, one baby changing station, and no stalls! I went to 4 different locations to find one that didn't have a line.

I have to say the price was fair and I'm glad they did not increase the price during that time. I also picked up a used rock island armory 1911 during one of their sales. It was a display model and upon inspection it did not appear that it had been used much. I'm very happy with my purchases and will do business with them again. Any firearm purchase also includes a free range pass which is a great way to test out your newly purchased firearm!

It's one of the few clothing store in my area in a shopping center with a Target. Kohls sends me mail all. the. time. How they got my information is beyond me, but I've been on the tail end of a \"I don't have any money left in my bank account\" kind of month. BTW - if you've ever wondered how much it sucks to pay for grad school out-of-pocket, well, it sucks a lot.\n\nI have a banquet I am going to in honor of one of my professors from college and I really wanted to get a new dress and jewelry. Unfortunately I have very little money right now. I decided, what the hell, I will check out Kohls and just see if they have something I can afford. \n\nTo begin with the store itself is fine. There's really nothing wrong with it save for some things being a tad messy. To me it looks as though they are understaffed, hence the reason for the messiness. They had a sparse amount of employees working when I was there. No one at the registers. No one in the jewelry department. No one really milling about in the misses clothing either. I was not asked if I needed any help. I browsed and found a dress and went into the fitting rooms. The one I went in still had clothing hanging up in it.\n\nI browsed the jewelry section and found a necklace. Seems as though everything here is either 40% or 50% off or some kind of sale. \n\nLastly when I went up to pay there were two girls and between the two of them it took a few minutes to figure out who was going to ring me up. I ended up being escorted back to the jewelry counter to be rung up for my purchases. The girls were nice enough, just a little disorganized.\n\nOverall I would never shop here on the regular.

I specifically told the man to not have anyone roll the windows down because they get stuck and don't go back up. He put the note in and told me if would be about 30 minutes.\n\n30 minutes later I went over and paid and then the man says at the end...oh yeah well I put the note in about the windows but they didn't see it. So I said, well are any of the windows down? And he said yes, one of them is all the way down. As I stared there in semi-shock, he says \"would you like me to call a manager\" and I said yes...\n\nSo a minute later the manager comes by and asks what the problem is and I told him what had happened. Then a guy from the garage walks up and the manager tells him to go look at it and fix it. The manager was very nice and told them that if they couldn't fix it without taking the door off, to come and find him. \n\nSo I followed 2 auto men out to the car and the one guy acted as if it is such an inconvenience and that somehow it is my fault that he had to sit there and get the window up.\n\nI'm so sorry Mr. Auto Garage Man that you guys' didn't take 2 seconds to read the notes and now you have to fix your mistake. \n\nI understand that Wal-Mart is cheap and I also understand that people make mistakes, but to be so rude about it and not acknowledge the mistake or to think it is okay to just leave it, is simply unacceptable. I know that I am young and no nothing about car service or auto anything, but I do know the value of good customer service, and that is far from what I experienced here. \n\nI will not be going back to this auto-service and I will be urging others to do the same.

This store is well stocked with great items at great prices.  There is certainly no shortage of items to choose from in all sizes.  They have everything from dresses, dress pants, jeans, sweaters, jackets, blazers, workout wear, shoes, accessories, and maternity clothes.  Really something for everyone.  They are very selective when buying clothes which I think makes the difference here.  They will only buy clean like new items that are from the past year (you almost can't tell you are shopping consignment).  It is a little different from the botique consigment shops that are around town in that it is focused on the clothes not the atmosphere.  During the month of January they had a 50% off sale which then went to 75% off the last few days included all clearance items being $3 then $2 then $1 they donated all remaining clothes to clear out for new items.  This allows the store to keep current with their offerings and always have new items to look through.  Not to mention the deals that I got shopping during the clearance sale.  Purchased most items between $3-$8 each.  This store is a must see for all you ladies who love to shop but are on a budget.

As Claire C mentions, it is a chain and whilst I am definitely all about supporting local sometimes you have to concede that chains have bigger stock and supply. I had already been to two other bike shops in Edinburgh, both independents, and hadn't found *my* bike. None just felt right.\n\nBut even on a Sunday, when the stock was low at Evans, they had the perfect bike for me. A sexy little number, in red, hybrid with two sets of gears and a white seat and a little bell. The customer service was really good, they let me test the bike no bother, and when we pushed them to have the alts done by 2.30pm (with only an hour of work-time) as we were pushed for time, the guy hurried it through for us.\n\nAdmittedly some of the stock is really quite expensive compared to other places. So I held off buying my bag and padlock from here. But for the bike itself, Evans have a great range and good customer service to go. No rushing, no pushing onto one bike or another (I was torn between a hybrid and a road bike). Although newbies be warned (as I am a newbie) - most bike shops like to keep the seat higher than you might need as it's good for the legs and you can get more push and it's general better bike-riding But as a noob I need my seat low, lower, noooo lower. So don't be afraid to keep asking them to adjust it till it's the perfect fit for you.\n\nTHere's also a free check-over the bike in 6 weeks time, and they run a 'how to care for your bike' class once a month.

My problems with Best Buy as a concept exist at this particular location as well - smarty-pants employees who are either rude and condescending or \"special\" in a retarded sort of way.\n\nCorporate gives the employees study materials on new products and the information is often flawed or wrong or incomplete leading to the employees having bad information or else having no clue at all. This means that when you ask a blue shirt to help you in your television selection, they will give you crap information with confident bravado and if you disagree, they act like you're a moron and dismiss you with righteous impunity.

It's like - \"welcome to our store, please feel free to browse and touch and buy whatever you want... on your way out, we're gonna frisk you like the dirty thief you are.\" I just bought this shit 10 feet from here - right over there *points*... you WATCHED me buy it.

Thankfully the genius who designed this store was smart enough to put baskets in the back. So I unloaded my treats into a basket and continued on in wander. Japanese candy for my best friend, salmon skin treats for the furballs in my life, flavored coffee syrups for my mother (s'more flavor...exotic, lol) European candy, Thai tea!!! Furniture, toys, bath section, kitchen gadgets, wines! Sensory overload. Exhausted and enthralled I made my way to the cashier. They have a members club! Free! Signed up and now I receive coupons. I have gone back several times now. It's a wonderful place to find unexpected gifts for those you love and hard to find specialty food items. Like I said before and I mean it.

My husband and I were in the market for two main purchases, track lighting and carpet.  We spent at least 15 minutes in the track lighting section and needed some help, but never saw any employees.  We then went over to the carpet section.  We were looking to replace our carpet in the living room and we were ready to make a decision.  We spent approximately 30 minutes in this area and even had a carpet picked out that we really like, but again we never saw any employees in this area either.  I heard other customer complaining as well.  Finally we abandon the few items we'd pick out to purchase and drove over to Home Depot.  They were awesome and ended up getting our business.", "business_id": "TGvd6vB2nRsWIrWr7Qca3g", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-02-18", "type": "review"}

From all directions.\nWe made the mistake of going there on a day that there was a game, and now as well they have Tanger shopping outlets next door. Too much traffic, too much in one small area.\nAnyway, the good things are, it is a huge store with a lot of things for outdoor fun. \nThey have a lot for the kids to see as well. When we went they had free photos with Santa, He is sitting on an ATV, not in a throne or anything. \nBut, it is free and that is always a blessing in these tough times. \nSanta was located in the Natural Museum, which is also free. Another great thing for the kids. They had free letters to Santa, coloring, and other little craft things for kids.\nThere is an archery and a Riffle field for kids to shoot for fun, just like the old Rawhide as well.\nSome things are really high priced, but good quaility.\nThey have a little cafeteria type cafe. They sell certain wild animal meats.  Also, a great little candy store with Fudge(about 20 kinds) that they make right there on the premise.\nThis is a place you can spend hours in, and really enjoy yourself.\nThe staff is very helpful, there was a girl named Sterfanie that really went out of her way to find us a good Dog bed.\nIt is an interesting place and it can be very educational as well,\nI highly recommend it.", "business_id": "KFg2T3nHlzjMByX4y_V8LA", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-12-18", "type": "review"}

Just entering the store is like going on Mr. Toad's Wild Ride - once you enter, you can't leave until you've taken the entire tour through the maze of shitty Swedish furniture. They provide you with cheap shitty food, a place to crap or puke it out, and strategically placed seating so you can rest. They black out the windows so you have no sense of time as well. It's evil genius. \n\nI think it's absurd that people actually eat here - like they just accept that they are being held prisoner by an evil Swedish furniture factory. The cheap food is too cheap - it's gut-rot inducing and it pains me just to think about it. Hot Dogs and Meat Balls? Are you serious? You don't even know what kind of mystery meat it is - much less if it's even real meat... and you happily pay a buck like you're really sticking it to the man with your bargain meal. Gag me.\n\nJust like at Disneyland, people bring their fucking ugly kids here and allow them to run around free screaming like wild animals. Parents use their strollers as battering rams to make way through the crowd. Nobody in there has ever showered in their life. I sometimes suspect that everyone there is a paid extra - nobody is ever buying anything.\n\nThere are two ways to shop here: 1. Arrive having researched and read the catalog and have a specific list of things to buy. 2. Wander around aimlessly for 3 hours, pick up something that you kinda need and carry it around with you for another 3 hours, give up the moment you have the exit door in sight and leave your single pathetic item on a pallet of flat-pack deck chairs and bypass the checkout lines so you can taste freedom at last.\n\nIKEA furniture is cheap, but expensive. It looks nice from far away, but up close you can see that it's junk. Run your hand along any of their wood counter surfaces and you'll feel the warping. Have a look at any corner on any dresser and you'll see the finish peeling away. It's good for utility furniture or to fill out a guest bedroom or storage room or kids room, but unless you're a college kid - this furniture is garbage. To top it off, it's overpriced. \n\nThe only things worth buying here are lightbulbs and batteries (which honestly aren't that great) because they are cheap. Even their flatware is crap - it rusts... yes, it rusts. You're better off going to Tuesday Morning or Ross or even Target and picking up something nicer. Don't be fooled by the contemporary modern urban stylings - IKEA is overpriced crappy junk. It's not cheap because they flat pack and pass the savings on to you - it's cheap because it's junk. \n\nI have some IKEA dressers and I use them as DVD storage - they work fine, but I don't expect them to last forever. Their couches are all uncomfortable, their chairs are even worse. The beds are barely one step up from sleeping on the floor. Their kitchen and bathroom cabinets are awful - you'll be sorry if you remodel your rooms with this stuff. \n\nI like the look of IKEA - honestly, I do. I think it's a good concept and they have some really good style ideas. Nothing they sell is really well-made and assembly is required... considering what it is, it's overpriced. That said - you can find some decent stuff here.

I paid for this service, and am I not the customer? I guess I don't really matter and I'm not coming back.

So be warned about this place. First of all if you schedule home delivery it'll cost you a pretty penny and if you have to reschedule you have to drive down to them to do so where they will charge you again. In my case another $129. If they have to store it it's an additional $10 per day surcharge. It's all in the contract that they have you sign.

And during those other two months, there are misters aplenty.\n\nTo address a previous review regarding needing to drive from one side to another due to how spread out it is: aren't all malls that way?  There's the main building, but the stores and restaurants surrounding the mall \"campus\" (like Target, Red Lobster or Holiday Inn) are outside the radius of the main parking lot.  If anything, I think TMP solved that; the outside stores are in a strip forming an L shape around the SW side, and the more mall-esque area is in the middle, away from parking.  Other random restaurants are dotted throughout the North end of the mall.  \n\nThe selection of stores and food is vast.  Seafood, sushi, burgers, dessert, steak, Mexican, alcohol, and more.  There are big stores like Target, JC Penny and Michaels, lots of smaller boutique clothing stores, and several random shops.

Today was the last straw for me. \n\nLiterally, EVERY SINGLE TIME I go in there to stock up on my cosmetic products, they are out of most of the things I need. I don't know who is in charge of maintaining their stock, but they have no clue what they are doing because they can't ever seem to keep enough product on their shelves. It's been this way for over a year. Want the latest eyeshadow palette that came out? Forget it, they'll be out of it. Looking for your favorite black eyeliner pencil? Forget it, they'll be out of that too. Want to shop for a new eyeliner because they are out of yours? Ha! Good luck finding a tester and having to spend $20 on a new one without knowing if its worth the money. \n\nOn top of that, while shopping today, I was watched like a hawk by the lady working in cosmetics. She was really friendly, but goodnight! I don't want someone standing 5 feet away from me as I browse the isles for 45 minutes. Whenever I changed isles, she did. It was so absurd. Sorry I didn't curl my hair to perfection and put on a ton of makeup before I came shopping today, but this isn't Scottsdale and it certainly doesn't mean that I'm a thief.\n\nSo I finally went to check out, expecting that since I was spending the $30 or more on Benefit products, that I would get my free travel size Benefit items that they were promoting on signs in the store (hooray for free travel size of They're Real Mascara!). Did he offer them to me when he finished checking me out? No. I had to ASK for them as he was trying to send me on my way, and then acted like I ruined his day by bringing it up. Ridiculous. \n\nI won't be shopping here anymore. I am not going to spend money on high-end cosmetics at a store that treats me like a thief, is constantly out of everything I need, and doesn't adhere to the special promotions that THEY have advertised. No thanks. \n\nSephora here I come!", "business_id": "E4fsijuAlC_jhhM4i8q_Ew", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-02-14", "type": "review"}

(Score Again,)\n\nI have never had a sales rep pay that much attention to my needs but it didn't stop there, she knew I needed cases for the tablets and this store was out so she stopped by another store the next morning and got the cases from them so I wouldn't have to make another trip.

That is until I had to go grocery shopping, then I missed Texas just a bit. You see in Texas I lived less than a mile away from a beauty of a store called Aldi. I had the grocery shopping down, most staples at Aldi, a monthly Costco visit and then a Kroger and Tom Thumb every 2 weeks. Coming back to AZ I had to start all over, with the  visits to Walmart, Fry's and Safeway but not really happy with the prices or quality of their store brands. I still missed Aldi's bargain prices, the amazing quality of their store brand products and how super fast their cashiers were. \n\nWhere was I? WinCo.

I told the \"genius\", Sean, that the iPad had been a gift from a relative and that I was really disappointed when it had stopped functioning. Sean told me Apple would replace it, and I would have to come back in the next few days to pick up my new iPad. He placed the order for me, but neglected to mention that since I was not the original purchaser of the iPad that I would have to go thru World War 3 to retrieve the replacement. Apparently I am the only person in the history of the company to have received an Apple product as a gift, as the process of product replacement is, to say the least, not exactly streamlined.\n\nA few days later, I returned to the store for my date with destiny, and Chuy. He came out with my new iPad, and asked for my ID. He asked me who had bought the iPad, since the names did not match. I told him it was a relative with whom I did not share a surname. He explained that he could not release the iPad until I called the store and added my name to the account. I thought it was a little strange, calling a store I was currently sitting in, but I did as he asked. I waited on hold for ten minutes, while Chuy sat across from me looking disinterested, until a rep finally picked up. I explained to her that I was in the store and had been instructed to call the store and ask that my name be added to the account under which the iPad had been purchased so I could pick up the replacement. She put me on hold.\n\nA few minutes later, a woman emerged from a back door. She walked up to Chuy and asked him why he had had me call (I was still on hold, and this was clearly the woman with whom I had been speaking...). He explained his instructions, and she said to him (as if I weren't there) that I had to have the original purchaser of the iPad call the store. She left without a word to me, and I hung up. I handed Chuy the old iPad, and asked him if there was any way he could check the serial number to make sure it was the iPad that was to be replaced. He checked, only to tell me that although it was the same iPad as the one on his work order, there was no way to prove my identity as the owner of the iPad. I gave him my address, phone number, driver's license, my uncle's info (the purchaser), email addresses, Apple IDs, and passwords. This was still not sufficient. Exasperated, I called my uncle.\n\nI explained that he needed to call the store, verify his identity as the original purchaser, and release the replacement iPad to me. He asked if I could just hand them my cell phone, since he was already on, and they said \"No, the call must come thru our circuits.\" We hung up, and he called. About ten minutes later, he called me back, only to tell me that he had been on hold for ten minutes, (while I had been sitting there, of course), and that he was done playing the sit-and-wait-on-hold game for something as asinine as all this was in the first place. Having been a longtime Apple customer, and an avid vocal proponent of their outstanding products and services, he could not understand why they wouldn't just take the call from him to my cell phone directly, or at least expedite his wait time.\n\nI eventually located Chuy again, who had wandered into the back somewhere, no doubt watching the light blink while my uncle had sat on hold. I again tried to hand my phone, with my uncle on it, to Chuy. He refused. I asked if there was any way he could call my uncle directly to avoid this \"wait time\" nonsense. Chuy decided that he would check the account, and call the number associated with the account directly. That way, whoever he spoke with would be able to identify his or her identity, and then release the new iPad to me. Chuy left while I stayed on the line with my uncle, waiting for Chuy to call him.\n\nA few seconds later, my call waiting beeped. I answered, and Chuy introduced himself over the phone. I said, \"Chuy, it's me. I'm still in the store, and I'd like to pick up my iPad.\" Turns out, my uncle had used my phone number to register the iPad when he had purchased it. Chuy asked me my name, and had me spell it (he had already seen my driver's license and taken my name twice prior to all this). He hung up, came back out, and almost an hour after I had come into the store, handed me the new iPad. Needless to say, he did not offer to install the new software (which took almost another hour when I got home).\n\nOverall, I am dreading my next experience with Apple. While I understand the need to protect against theft and whatnot, this was just ridiculous.\n\nSide note, I am currently a droid owner, and this is the first time I have ever owned an Apple product. Also, this is the first time I ever considered getting an iPhone.

I was recently up for an upgrade to my older model iPhone. Having had a fantastic experience at the Apple store when I got the first one, I did the upgrade there again. At the same time I wanted to change my cell phone number to a local number. While Apple wasn't able to help with that, I did pop by this AT&T store to do it. \n\nOn the first visit, I was promptly greeted upon walking in the door. I let the guy know I needed a new car charger and wanted to change my number. The car charger was no problem, but there would be a 30-minute wait due to the heavy business in the store. I wasn't in a rush, so that was okay.  I came back a couple days later and was helped by someone else, who was just as helpful. I only had to wait a few minutes while he called AT&T support to relocate my account. He helped me choose a new phone number, and the store manager made sure to put all my employer discounts back on my new relocated account. We'll see when the first bill arrives, but hopefully all's well. It was also very cool that the store manager likes to greet every customer who comes in - what a nice business touch. \n\nI had a very good experience at this store. The only downside is the extremely tiny parking lot, which is shared with the adjoining Wells Fargo. Very, very tight parking. I recommend this AT&T store, but you might want to go outside banking hours.", "business_id": "lXHZKLQ9-03zj1vJq5a1YQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-03-27", "type": "review"}

But, for what it's worth, I also feel like weighing in my two cents.  The store is massive and filled with a plethora of cheap, but trendy looking furniture and home goods.  Some of it is great.  Some of it is garbage.  Most of it is perfect for an apartment or rental home, especially if you'd rather ditch your stuff rather than move it.  For a guy like me who has moved more times than I'd care to remember, Ikea has been the choice decor for many apartments for the past six or seven years it's been in the valley.  Much of it has also ended up in a dumpster or with the Salvation Army, and I can't say that I miss it (although I regret the couple of times I've bought the same thing a couple years later).\n\nBe sure to check out anything you plan to purchase in the showroom on the upper level before you buy it.  If you don't, you have no one to blame for assembling a cheap and uncomfortable piece of crap except yourself.  There's plenty of maps you can grab, if you're affraid of getting lost in the market place, feel free to take one.  It's okay, no one will laugh at you.  The amazing Odor of the cinnamon rolls in the cafeteria is pure ecstasy.  The crowds are unbearable on weekends, but if you can make it to Ikea during the week, you're golden.

My mother and my sister both work at a Nordstrom (Mom is pacesetter at the one in Troy, MI and my sister is the manager of men's sportswear at the Novi, MI location) so I am extremely familiar with how Nordstrom's customer's service is supposed to be.  While my experience yesterday was mostly positive, there was one gripe that I have that I will tell about a little later.\n\nSo, I decided that I had to do a little makeover yesterday.  I was going out with girlfriends that night, and since I have been a little negative lately, I thought that buying a new outfit, makeup, and shoes would do the trick.  So, first I went to the MAC counter to see if I could book a makeover session...they took me right away which shocked the crap out of me.  The girl asked me what I wanted, and I just said (yes I did) I want to look friggin hot.  With only that information in mind, Patty did the most amazing job that anybody ever did on my face.  I literally felt better already.  (and yes, I bought the colors that she applied...)\n\nThen, here comes my negative experience.  Now, I know that I do not look like the typical Nordstrom shopper, but I am not a raggy looking person either.  I went to the TBD dept looking for something that I knew that I would never wear normally.  There were about 5 girls working, just gossipping with each other, not paying me any mind.  At first I wasn't annoyed.  But when they would help others, that is when I became a little frusturated.  Then, which my two pairs of jeans and 4 shirts that I was holding felt a little heavy, I tried to get a girl's attention, only to be ignored.  I was amazed.  I even dropped a shirt (maybe on purpose) and I got nothing.  I had this one tall blonde staring at me but never came over.  Then some young girl walked in the dept. and she ran over to help her.  Maybe I was being a little irrational, but this is not the customer service that I ever experienced at a Nordstrom.  I finally went up to a girl and said as much and couldn't believe the experience I was having.  She was standing there in a state of shock, and I began to felt bad.  In the end, Crystal did a great job with helping me, and even picked out a couple of shirts that I would have never thought of buying before.  \n\nSo, Nordstrom at Chandler Fashion Square was redeemed, though I personally like the one at Scottsdale a whole lot better.  I know that Nordstrom is now going with the smaller, two stories look for most of their stores now (the new one they are building in N Scottsdale will be like the one in Chandler) but I love the variety at Scottsdale a whole lot better.  And a shout out to Thea at Scottsdale, who literally does the best personal shopping ever over there.", "business_id": "e1TRaM2GZq8qBFogZaNklw", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-01-20", "type": "review"}

Here's the run-down: There's a great selection of movies to rent, also varied sales of old (gently used) dvds. Hydroponic plants are for sale up front, along with seeds and planters. \nFreindly, knowledgable staff run the counter. I was impressed by the huge poster of Fritz Lang's \"Metropolis\" in front, a sign of taste as I understood it. \nGo in the basement for even more genres. The spiral-stairs are in the back, use the maps to find your way. \nThis place sells & rents anime - we need more of that here. Support them in that noble cause. And, y'know, local and all..\nThey were out of new membership cards, so I got a paper barcode. Its still in my wallet, I hope. Not a problem but I hope they get their organization together a bit more. \nMost recently I rented Satoshi Kon's Perfect Blue; I'd wanted to see it for years. Thanks to Four Star I didn't have to buy it! Now others can enjoy it too, the beauty of physical media rental *(hint, hint)*.\nPrice: reasonable, not extreme either way. 24/7 dropoff is nice and insomniac-user friendly. Registering for membership was so quick and painless I barely noticed, card/barcode issue aside. It shouldn't put anyone off getting something from here, even if a one-time impulse. \nWith no Blockbuster, Sam Goody or fye in town, places like this are more essential than ever. I'm not anti-streaming, but with fees, almost complete lack of many genres and other drawbacks, I sometimes prefer the tangible, near-instant gratification of brick & mortar stores. That, and its more likely to have what I'm looking for than any service and none of the hassle involved in finding a decent bootleg. \nThe only drawback I encountered was perhaps a kind of lack of selection. Their stock is vast & diverse so its not an issue of anyone else being better; but on certain things like multivolume sets they're missing some volumes, so watching the entire thing is... less fun. Fortunately this was the exception, titles were usually the best pressings with the best quality, features, master, etc. of all releases, digital (if any) or media. This pleasantly surprised me, they're often hard or impossible to find. I wish they had even more, or soon someone decides to donate their discs. \nNothing I've rented had errors or scratches. \nAll said I'm happy, no, proud to support my local video store!

Wow - they've redone quite a bit of the store - there's now a huge area dedicated to the Nook, and if I didn't know better, I'd swear they had expanded the store by several tens of thousands of square feet - it's open, airy, and huge.\n\nAfter wandering for a few minutes, I found the cooking area. Fail number one: organizing books by author's name. I understand certain titles lend themselves more favorably to knowing the author... so, I reached for my phone, looked at Amazon's website, found the author's names, and started scouring for the books.\n\nCraft Cocktails - one copy available. Price? No where to be found. So, I wandered around until I found an employee, with whom I inquired about the price. He showed me the UPC code on the back and showed me how to decipher the code to extrapolate the price, which was - wait for it - full MSRP - $50.00.\n\nI saw the exact same book, no more than a few minutes earlier, online for $31.06 with free shipping and no tax. No thanks, B&N.\n\nI repeated the same song and dance for Ad Hoc at Home - once again, Barnes and Noble didn't have a price tag posted, but I was able to find the retail price of... $50.00 clearly marked on the back dust jacket. Wow. Amazon? $28.50 new, $17 used (\"in excellent condition\").\n\nI appreciate that this is a brick and mortar store, complete with couches, chairs, coffee shops, and dozens of employees wandering around. But... really? I can't bring myself to spend nearly twice the going rate for books that are now 5+ years old. \n\nI said it in my tip, and I'll say it again - it's no wonder bookstores are failing.

I got married in April 2014 and since it was just a simple ceremony with family members and a few closed friends, I didn't plan on getting a bouquet. My husband told me that I should get one so I have something in my hands. I went in to the shop around February, 2 months before to our big day, picked out a small calla lily bouquet and asked a specific ribbon color (tan in satin material) and was told it could be matched. The small bouquet which only has like a handful of flowers, cost $90. I thought, that's expensive but I didn't want to run around town for a bargain and sucked it up and paid for it based on the awards and reviews. I even sent email with photos of my wedding shoes so the arrangement person knows exactly what color I am talking about. \n\nThen, the day came, my husband picked up the bouquet while I got ready in the hotel room. He brought it back and boy was I upset. The ribbon was brown. Brown. Dark brown. Not tan. I would not have been upset if the ribbon was camel, tan, whatever. But it was brown. It was not anywhere close to the photos I had sent to the shop. \n\nIn hindsight, I wished I had gone and picked it up myself so I could have had it fixed and instead I had my husband to do it and he had no idea what the hell he was looking at. \n\nIf I ever get flowers again for whatever reason, I am definitely requesting a trial so I know what to expect.", "business_id": "AAqVpQ4TkN1O9dezF0ZfEQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-01-04", "type": "review"}

Still, if it's more even more popular in winter, I can't imagine having a good time squeezing in there with so many other people.\n\nDisorganized: the directory was confusing. Where's that Benetton's that's supposed to be on the third floor? Oh it's out of business. The Gap is on two floors but only listed on one, and the storefront says Gap Kids, even though men's and women's sections were included. Also, of 50+ shops, less than ten sell men's attire, and half of those are accessory, underwear, or shoe stores. There's no electronics or games stores at all, so ladies, give your man an iPad if you make him come here with you. The stores themselves were messy as well. Bigger shops had crumpled merchandise strewn about and many had little identifiable logic to their layouts, at least to me.\n\nI wasn't too crazy about the selection either.  I think I've got an innate need to forage, because I love browsing the aisles, even at the grocery store. I could spend an hour reading vitamin bottles at CVS.

The only strange smell was the linger smell of smoke, but other than that, each section is labeled by their brand names (American Eagle, Abercombie, Hollister, Bebe, etc). \n\nWith that in mind, be aware that is what to expect when stepping in there. I like TT a lot better than Plato's Closet, where they carry the same kinds of stuff, but more expensive and about the same price as retail. TT has better prices and the clothes are largely spaced out. Good for the claustrophobic. \n\nHowever, I did not heed the good advice of Yelpers here when I went to resell my clothes. I thought, \"Hey, I have a good amount of F21, JCrew, H&M -- something's gotta work.\" Out of 2 bags, they took only the F21 gladiator sandals, five pairs of F21 jeans, and an H&M cocktail dress. They truly only look for those types of brands -- really anything an on-budget college student would wear. I didn't think they'd take any of my basics from said shops so I left those out and brought my more unique, \"eccentric\" pieces and those were all rejected. \n\nThey're currently looking for Fall/Winter clothing, but nothing too \"strange\" mind you. My bf wanted to resell a pair of cobalt blue JCrew pants, but they rejected it because they wanted only black slacks for the student who wanted it for interviews. \n\nI was able to find a great Banana Republic dress and JCrew-esque statement necklace. I would recommend raiding your closets for any brands a teenager would wear or any basics found at mall stores (H&M, F21, A&F, etc). \n\nTips: *There is a 2 bag limit, as opposed to a previous reviewer who said that was nonexistent. Read the rules. \n*Fold your clothes neatly in shopping bags. \n*Wash your clothes.

St. Vincent de Paul is a great charity thrift store.\n\nWhen our Saturday plans of yard sale shopping were thwarted by the rain (I am still in Arizona, right?) we decided to hit up some thrift and antique stores and stay dry.\n\nI've lived near this SVDP for years, but have somehow never made it inside.  We wandered in and I was immediately impressed.  For a small space, they have managed to get a lot of quality items in.  They are also better organized than most thrift stores - even the books (and this was a BIG selection) are sorted so it's easy to browse.\n\nThen I saw it.....a 1950's Kenmore sewing machine - the kind build into a desk....  It was pure beauty.  When I asked if it worked, the staff brought out an extension cord and let me fire it up.  While listening to the gentle purr of the machinery I fell in love.  This was a great sewing machine, and it was clearly well used and well loved - it even had feet and attachments I'd never seen before.  I had no problem with the sticker price of $65, but then the staff informed me that it was 50% off that day!  So I got an even more amazing deal.  They were great about marking it as sold so that I could come back and pick it up later.  \n\nI know not everyone will find a deal like that, but as far as thrift stores go, I couldn't have had a better experience.", "business_id": "QO5ojtq9u2so-S_tYmeHsA", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-02-22", "type": "review"}

I went to this apple store after going to a competitor and can say they really helped me save money.  I went in ready to buy a new unit when one young man said why not buy refurbished on line and have it delivered.His logic waas that they had gone farther through a refurbished machine when they got it back than with the regular brand new machines.  Something to be said for his line of thought I thought about this long and hard and checked what was available online for a month.  Later I went back and worked with an associate named Jessica who showed me logically that I was going to spend more money than I needed to, about $500 dollars!?!.  The refurbished unit came in faster than i expected/  I took my old machine that had half the tech staff came out looking at it and saying \"It still works?\"  They loaded the new one with the info from the old  machine and got it the same day.  Later that evening, I realized nothing was going as it should in updating necessary information.  The  next day, I made and appoint meant and hauled everything over there.  My final contact was with a delight flu woman named Elizabeth.  She proceeded to show me that about half of what I had load off the old machine wasn't necessary and would have caused exactly what was going wrong.   I can't tell you how much time she took to remove things I didn't need.  She also explained something to me that I think should have been told before.  Safari is a product of Mac, I was not  this  before. In my opinion, it only  makes sense to use it when I am on a macintosh computer.  From seeing what Elizabeth work today, I realized I've run into problems previously because no one told me about she benefit of using safari and mac together.\n\nYeah, Jessica, for saving me money!

It sure beats selling on eBay if you don't want to have the effort in dealing with shipping and fees. Their comics section is pretty interesting as well. I don't know much about the rarity of comics, but I bought a few with some leftover credit I had. Movies are fairly priced as well, but I'm still waiting on a copy of Kung pow!\n\nA great thing to take advantage of is holding items. If you find an item you like, but hesitate to purchase, you can hold the item behind the counter for 7 days. That'll give you time to go home and come back the next day with some useless junk for credit toward your held item :)\n\nOh and I guess the books are cool", "business_id": "L9N4loWpY2bmQumLUv8r3A", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-11-06", "type": "review"}

I still get a whiff of excitement when I step into the showroom -- less so than when I first set foot in the new store, but it's still there. Maybe it's the heady aroma of particle board, golf pencils, meatballs, and screaming kids waiting in line for Smland... not sure?\n\nThe upstairs showroom is really the best part of IKEA. They change it up enough that it's interesting on repeat visits. If I ever get crammed into a 300 sq ft living enclosure in Prague, I'll be all set as far as decorating ideas. The restaurant is still cool. Shame people can't seem to get on board with the whole \"clear your own table\" thing, because there are always messes around when I go there. Where else can you get lingonberry soda though, really. \n\nOne lingers in the showroom because you know that somewhere in the distant future you have to get to the downstairs part where you actually buy stuff and lift hundreds of pounds of flat, wide boxes into your cart and eventually your vehicle. They design the boxes this way so you can fit them in your Peugot or MINI, despite the fact that most Americans have more cargo space than your average Boeing 747. Frankly, I'd rather the boxes be shaped like dumbbells or body bags so at least I can lift something I've had practice with.\n\nOh, IKEA. Here is where you lose a star. The self check-out is absolutely revolutionary but it cannot dominate the commerce area. You have one full-service checkout for the absolutely soulless but everything else is self. I love it personally, because I can get out of there without the faffing and inane chatter that goes along with interacting with a clerk. But the masses simply cannot or will not bring their A-game when it comes to the scanners and payment devices. It requires a delicate symphony of grabbing merch, getting those lasers lined up right, bagging, paying. Lasers!

To make things even more inviting, the cigar lounge is not exclusive to cigar club members. It's open to anyone and everyone!\n\nOwl Ear offers a fantastic selection of premium cigars, premium cigarettes, lighters and smoking accessories, as well as BEAUTIFUL humidors! Cigar afficianodos take their cigars very seriously, and settle for nothing less than the best when it comes to housing them. Here, even the most particular cigar smoker will be sure to find the perfect humidor to house their collection.\n\nI was in a rush as I was leaving this last time, so I didn't get the particulars for what appeared to be a cigar storage program.

You drive by and see that all of the windows are covered in black. It's really easy to miss.

It's pretty obscure and is out of Germany, something I knew Zia didn't have and that no other store would have. I called up, asked the guy at the counter if they had it, and they did. Awesome.\n\nI walked in to find some very serious black metal playing. Pentagrams were numerous. There was a large selection of metal shirts, and both walls were completely lined with metal. There were some serious metalheads there including the guy behind the counter. He had on his Dark Funeral hat, black hair, huge gauges in his ears, etc. These are all things I can deal with, but wish I didn't have to. Basically, the store tries too hard to be metal, just like 99% of metalheads. Be ready to deal with these things if you are coming in here and are not a fan of extreme metal. It is not targeted at you, and you may not feel entirely comfortable. Now, this doesn't mean you can't buy a CD here. You just need to be able to handle the above. I'm a normal guy. I don't look like a metalhead, and they welcomed me perfectly fine. \n\nAs for the new CD selection. It is VAST. You will find a ton of extreme metal here. Death metal, black metal, thrash metal, goregrind, whatever floats your boat. If you can't understand the vocals, they probably have it. There is a used CD section as well, but I couldn't figure out how to navigate it and gave up quickly. There's also a ton of memorabilia. The only real negative aside from the satan fetish is that the CDs are a bit higher priced.

So I call rcwilley to get them to swap out the defective unit . But not so easy , they have me contact a second party contractor for frigidaire to \"inspect\" the unit . So Buy Right Appliance comes out , checks to make sure it's hooked up right then leaves . Um what happened to trouble shooting the issue ??? So I call rcwilley get the run around call buy right and they say it will be a couple weeks .... How's it a couple weeks ??? They didn't trouble shoot it ... So now here I am waiting again for someone to let me know what's going on . So much for rcwilleys return policy and \"we'll make sure your happy\" policy ....

If you've ever been measured at Victoria's Secret or some other mall store, you are probably wearing the wrong sized bra. If your straps fall down all the time, you're probably wearing the wrong sized bra. If you get the quad boob thanks to the cups cutting into the top of your boobs, you're probably wearing the wrong sized bra. If your band is riding up a ton, you're probably wearing the wrong sized bra. If you have a larger than average sized chest, you're probably wearing the wrong bra.  If you're wearing a size small or x-small shirt and you got your bra at Vicky's or a regular store, you're probably wearing the wrong sized bra. The workers at Contours know how to do proper bra fittings (or you can do them yourself with an online guide (www.reddit.com/r/abrathatfits) and bring in your size) and can help you find the styles that work best for you.  Bras here are going to be more expensive, but having one that properly fits makes a world of difference. When I went I came home with one new bra and noted several other styles that I liked which I may pick up online. They tend to be cheaper online, but getting to try on several different styles all at once is worth the premium prices you pay here. I didn't have an appointment, but rather just stopped by when out shopping. The sales gal I worked with didn't seem pushy at all and had a very relaxed pace. I wasn't rushed at all. \n\nI knew they had a nice selection of bras, but I was pleasantly surprised at the variety and quality of lingerie that they also had on hand. A wide variety of sizes from xsmall to plus sizes is wonderful to see. Fellas, if you want to get some quality undergarments for your ladies, this is the place to go.

This review is primarily about the amazing customer service I experienced today, but I can't help but gush about the store itself as well! \n\nBeing originally from the Bay Area, I had the luxury of growing up with a Nike Town within driving distance, so I was very excited to learn of the Nike store opening up at the Scottsdale Quarter. While on the hunt for a new pair of running shoes, I decided to see if the Nike store had them before purchasing them online. I visited the store and was immediately pleased by the stock, decor and overall feel of the store. It made me want to run 5 miles then and there! Sadly though, they didn't have the shoes in the color I was looking for. Apparently, I'm so \"trendy\" (note the sarcasm in the reference to being trendy) that the shoe color I wanted had only come out the day before! So ordering online it was. \n\nI ordered my shoes last Saturday, but Friday came and I hadn't heard a peep from Nike about my order...no email either. I decided to call the online store, only to be treated pretty rudely by the woman on the other line who told me that my order didn't exist and that I was wrong in saying that my credit card had been charged. However, I was sitting in front of my computer and had the proof that my card had in fact been charged. I tried explaining that my card had been charged, but she was instant that it was only a hold and that my order hadn't been placed (Wells Fargo confirmed that the card had in fact been charged and wasn't pending.) When I asked to speak with a Nike manager, I was hung up on. Needless to say, I was pretty upset and all I wanted were my tennis shoes without being charged twice! Before I filed a dispute with Wells Fargo, I decided to give the Nike store a call. The associate Ali picked up the phone and immediately started working with me to get my issue resolved. She took down my information and said that she'd look into it and call me back. Just like she promised, I received a call back from her within 15 minutes. Not only was she incredibly friendly and customer-service oriented, but she also found my order (even though the rude online customer service rep claimed it didn't exist). She gave me my order number, shipping number and tracking number and told me that my shoes are set to arrive on Monday. Voila! Thanks to Ali, I found my shoes, I wasn't charged twice and I didn't have to file a dispute with my bank. \n\nI must note that after speaking with the online rep and being treated so rudely, I vowed never to shop at Nike again. However, after the friendly treatment by Ali and eagerness to get my issue resolved, I am a believer in Nike again. Nike's online reps should take a few lessons from friendly associates like Ali on how to treat customers.", "business_id": "Q87G5ezBUhqjQ1xHfZ3fSA", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-07-06", "type": "review"}

If they aren't interested in your stuff it's because either a. It's all beat up b. They've already got a lot of it in stock or c. They don't think anyone will buy it. It's best to go on a less busy day that way the buyers have more time to thoroughly review your things. Bookmans isn't going to pay you full price for the books, of course. They need to make a profit too. They still do offer a generous amount. And the difference between the cash and trade is not as major as $22 trade and $2.50 cash, as another user said.

On our way home we looked for the closest vape shop to buy juice for the drive. We really just walked in on a whim with an idea of the juice we wanted and every intention to make a quick fast exit. \nWhen we asked for Riptide Pink Spot juice, they had just sold out of the 6 nicotine bottle; however the friendly owners told us they'd do us one better and make us their own blend of riptide with their own ingredients. We were intrigued, but had to get on the road fast so we told them that we might not have the time. The man told us he'd whip it up for us in two minutes. As he went in back to create the final product, I asked the lady about their store brand juice. She informed me that they use a less balanced percentage of PG and VG (typically its 50/50) but that it makes for a better cloud. She also told me that they use no extra fillers and their juice is simple and pure, flavoring, nicotine and pg and vg. She was really friendly and I didn't feel like she was trying to sell me on her product, she just seemed to be really confidant that theirs was really good and stood out above the rest. She also gave us a great deal on some extra pink spot flavors. The man returned with a glass bottle and their \"I Heart Vape\" logo on the bottle. We made small conversation as they rung us up, and they were really nice people. \n\nWe got in the car and dripped this homemade juice into our vape, and surprise! it was awesome! It was even BETTER than Pink Spot's rip tide and made a really big cloud. I was super impressed! Just to be sure I wasn't imagining this, I dripped some Pink Spot into the vape after it needed to be refilled, and could defintly tell the difference between the two. The I Heart Vape juice tasted much cleaner, less chemically, and was all around delicious. \n\nI don't typically write reviews for Vape shops, but I was so impressed by this one. I hope we can get some I Heart Vape Juice in California shops soon!

I can't speak to their doctors because I didn't get my exam here, but I can speak to their salespeople, pricing, and choices.\n\nI came here because they had a BOGO deal going on and I really needed a new pair of glasses and figured I would get some prescription sunglasses while I was at it.\n\nWhen I first walked in, everyone was friendly enough.  I was really underwhelmed by their selection of glasses, but managed to find a pair of sunglasses that I was okay with and a set of frames for regular glasses that would be all right.  \n\nWhen I sat down to talk about lenses, I was not asked what type of lenses or treatments I wanted.  The salesman (I don't know what his name was) just said that they would do the glare resistant.  I asked how much that would be and he quoted me roughly $350 (this was a BOGO deal, mind you, so he was quoting me a price for JUST the crappy $100 sunglass frames).  I said I could do without the glare resistant treatment and that I just wanted basic lenses...he reluctantly took it off.  Then he said \"Okay so then you'll have regular lenses in the eyeglasses and polarized in the sunglasses\".  So again, I asked him to quote me the price.  It knocked it down to about $310.  I told him that I wasn't in the market to spend upwards of $300 on one pair of glasses and that I would just take my business elsewhere.  Only then did he give me a quote for BASIC LENSES, which is what I asked for in the first place after being quoted such a high price.  Finally he told me it wouldn't be more than about $220 with basic lenses, and I agreed.  When he rang me up, it was closer to $250, but I was so tired of dealing with him that I just paid.  I was told to come back in a couple of hours and BOTH pairs of my glasses would be ready to go.\n\nMy sister and I walked around the mall for the two hours that it would take for the glasses to be ready.  I wasn't feeling great about the purchase because I felt like the options were limited and I just wanted to get out of there so badly because of the salesman's attitude.  We stopped in to LensCrafters, and I saw way more options for around the same price, and I liked them much better.  I was quoted $320 for designer frames and completed lenses on a pair for eyeglasses and sunglasses NOT during a BOGO sale.  I figured I would pick up my glasses at VisionWorks and if I ended up disliking them I would return them and go elsewhere another day (luckily they do have a 30 day money back guarantee).\n\nWhen I got back to VisionWorks to pick up the glasses, I was told that the tinting machine was broken and that I would have to pick up the sunglasses tomorrow.  I live across town from the mall, and after my poor experience with the man who had helped me earlier, I just asked for a full refund.  They gave it to me, but not without trying to get me to take the eyeglasses home.\n\nThis place was MUCH better when it was Eyemasters, and used to be the only place I bought my glasses.

This is a poor way to run a business. \n    I bought a wedding ring that had been discounted from 7500 to 2300. We were told upon our purchase that we would receive 180 dollars in points to spend but we would have to wait twenty four hours. Three weeks later we go back and they said that we were told wrong we had a grand total of 23 dollars in points. \n     When the ring arrived it had a price of 7000 which was 500 lower than the original price advertised on the ring which means we were charged around 200 dollars more than we should have paid after the discount. \n     I am very disappointed that the store manager could not do much to make this right she did give us 10 dollars off of our purchase of clothes. \n     I will go with snap on for my tools from now on and carhart for my clothes.

But boy, was I disappointed.  I walked in, and no one was to be found. I sat in the store for 20 minutes before I was helped. Someone even came out of the back, looked at me and smiled, and went back in while I was waiting to be helped. And when i finally got some service, I asked (just out of curiosity) if they had any straight razors for sale. The guy said he had quite a few actually, so I asked about a specific brand, and the rep said \"I don't like that brand, I can show you another.\" This was fine, I figured he didn't carry it. I asked if he did carry it, and he said yes. (Ok...) I asked to see what he had, and he refused. A little strange, I thought. However, this is not the reason I write a bad review, this place does kitchen stuff, mostly.  I told him \n\"I shave with straight razors, and I heard this was an excellent place to get them sharpened, how's much would it cost, and could you do it?\"\nAnd he said \"that depends. What do you plan in using it for?\" Um... Shaving. As is the purpose for the straight razor. \nNow at this point there are a lot of people judging me by this review. After all, to place does mostly kitchen stuff. However, personally, if the product is good, or even adequate, I couldn't care less about service. So here goes my experience with the product. \nI went down there to pick up 2 straight razors I had sharpened. I was told the razor sharpener also shaves with a straight razor, and does a wicked good job.  So I was looking forward to getting it back. I arrived, and I tested the razors on my arm hair, and the \"hanging hair test,\" both of which the razors are supposed to pass with flying colors to be safe to shave with. Neither razor could even pluck the hairs off my arm. I politely brought it up, and the representative apologized, and said if I wanted it sharpened again, they'd be more than happy to do that. I asked if they wouldn't mind, and the rep obliged. Came down later in the day to pick them up, and they we're sharoened. Barely. It still wouldn't cut the hair on my arm. And when I came to pick them up, there was another rep who tried to make me pay again for the re-sharpening. Ultimately, I explained my story, and she let it go. But in the end, I doubted myself, said its just buyers remorse, of some form. And I tried to shave with it and it wouldn't cut my facial hair. At all. I would up sharpening it myself, and ultimately I gave them nearly $30 (I also bought a cheap Chinese razor for shits and giggles, which wasn't up to par either, but hey, it was only like 10 bucks and makes a cool pocketknife.) and didn't get anywhere near a quality product.

Bank line of stores.  I've found their service, prices, quality, and selection to be absolutely top notch.  However, the Jos. A. Bank in Middleton may very well be one of the worst stores in the chain that I've ever visited.\n\nI've visited their store on several occasions, and have always felt as if I was \"bothering them\" by walking in the door.  Those suspicions were confirmed today, when I stopped in to have the three pair of pants that I had purchased from the Jos. A. Bank in Rogers, AR tailored and hemmed.\n\nI walked in to the store, which was for the most part empty, and stood at the counter for a few minutes before a gentleman reluctantly asked if he could \"help\" me with anything.  I believe he thought I was there to return the pants; when I asked if I could be fitted for the pants that I had bought last week, he let out a sigh and said, \"yeah, but they won't be ready for like three weeks - we're really backed up.\"\n\nI didn't care about the timeline; I have dozens of pairs of pants to wear, so the wait was no big deal.  I shared that info with him, and he sighed again and said, \"ok, come on back here.\"\n\nAfter he finished fitting me for the three pairs of pants, a manager (or I assume the person was a manager) stopped by and noticed that the gentleman had set a \"delivery date\" that was three weeks out.  The manager said, \"These are just a hem? We can get that done by Thursday.  He doesn't have to wait three weeks.\"\n\nThe guy that was fitting me said, \"Oh, I wasn't sure how busy we were, or if we were backed-up.\"\n\nI then said, \"Guys, I'm not in any hurry - it's no big deal, so take your time.\"  To which the manager replied, \"No, we're ok right now, so it's not a problem.  We could probably have them by tomorrow.\"\n\nSo then the guy who was fitting my pants said, \"Yeah, you can pick them up on Thursday.  Ok, let's get you up front to pay for this.\"  \n\nI was shocked; I'd never paid for tailoring at a Jos A Bank store before.  When I asked why there was a charge, the guy said, \"We always charge for tailoring, yep, always do.\"  So, $38 later, I guess I'll have three pairs of pants hemmed by Thursday (rather than early August as originally quoted)...\n\nOn a whim, I called my old Jos. A Bank store in Arkansas, and spoke to one of the sales people and asked about the tailoring fee.  He said, \"We're supposed to charge for it, but if you bought three pair of full-price pants from us, we'd usually do it as a service to our customer.\"\n\nI asked the guy at the Middleton store about that policy, and he said, \"They should all be fired there.  That's ridiculous.  We always charge. You'd get fired if you didn't.\"\n\nSo, there you have it.  Too bad for the customer.  I'm done with Jos. A Bank.

The associate then attempted to sell me on the REI membership card which included discounts, promotions and cash back at the end of the year.  I explained to him that I work for an online retailer that sells most of the items they do and this visit was my first time back there in 4 years and I don't need the card...which is the truth.  I mean, why would I shop anywhere else if I get a pretty nifty employee discount?!  Oh yeah, because I love to procrastinate!

(Just a warning, this is a little long winded, but might be helpful to the next engaged chick on her adventure through bridal gown shopping.)\n\n     My adventure in bridal gown shopping started at Alfred Angelo (http://www.yelp.com/biz/alfred-angelo-bridal-las-vegas#hrid:46afgVc-kjCuyeXIOTKIMw) where I've been a couple times before with other brides and for bridesmaid dresses, and each time the associates just seem to have a stick up their bums.  \n     Next, Celebrations Bridal had a very similar unhelpful experience.  \n     Bridal Elegant (http://www.yelp.com/biz/bridal-elegant-las-vegas#hrid:c5Lvha1GLQDhGnzDRKFVdA) gave me a breath of fresh air because the girls were actually really sweet.  Bridal Elegant had very nice dresses but they lack the inventory from being stuck in their temporary back office and the experience in helping me try on dresses.\n   David's Bridal (http://www.yelp.com/biz/davids-bridal-las-vegas-2#hrid:18WRVt6_Yw3ijOt1Lgzj6w) is a well oiled machine of a bridal store, so trying on dresses there was quick and efficient and the associates know what they're doing.  I think it's likely a right of passage for most to go through David's Bridal, but as much as I wanted to find something, I just couldn't find anything I absolutely loved.\n\nONTO REVIEWING Las Vegas Bridal Gowns:\n  This past Sunday I found Las Vegas Bridal Gowns boutique located inside the Griffin Mansions.  They are gated during the day, so you definitely need to set an appointment with Anna, the bridal salon manager, to get through the gates.\n  Upon walking in, you get to walk through part of Griffin Mansions to the very large bridal gown boutique.  It's a simple set up.  The large room has three walls filled with the most designs of Watters, Pronovias, Casablanca to name a few.  All the dresses are great quality, a very nice change from David's Bridal gowns.\n     Anna is very helpful when choosing dresses, gives great suggestions/ critiques, while sounding sincere.\n\nConclusion:  I really enjoyed my bridal gown fitting experience here, and I said \"yes\" to the dress!", "business_id": "foaRkveNRnXRt-QdOhzhXg", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-01-12", "type": "review"}

My wedding isn't until next year in September, but I at least wanted to try on different styles of dresses to see what looked best on me. The third one I tried on, I actually felt like a bride. I was glowing, and I felt beautiful. I really didn't want to have that bridal moment because it was just so early, I just wanted to try on different styles!!\n\nSurprisingly though, I called my Dad a few days after to ask him if he would escort me down the aisle. And then out of nowhere, he offered to pay for the dress that I loved. I almost started crying. It was so unexpected and it was one of the greatest things anyone has ever done for me.\n\nOf course, my matron of honor and I went back in 10 days later (same consultant: Ella. Love her!) and we bought the dress! Every time I think about it I get so happy. The first visit, I just told Ella to bring me a dress, any dress, that had a certain kind of style. It was supposed to be a test, but I loved it. Thank you Ella!!!\n\nI will definitely go back to shop for my bridesmaid dresses at this location. All of the staff are very nice, friendly, and they KNOW what brides want, and even something that the bride herself would never think of wearing. \n\nI highly recommend this location for another reason. Men's Wearhouse works alongside David's Bridal. For instance, the dresses for my bridesmaids are gonna be a Canary Yellow. Well, Men's Wearhouse can provide the tuxedos with the exact same color that David's Bridal has. I think that's unbeatable. \n\nThank you David's Bridal!", "business_id": "SmxYzoYDxMRMahF-PO7gHg", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-06-07", "type": "review"}

Each time I came in I didn't get a hello, or a gesture to help me find something. The only time I was ever addressed is when I rested a hand on their counter/display case! I was told not to touch it. I'm sorry... but what?! When have you ever gone to a jewelry store and they told you not to touch the glass? Not only that, but when I would ask to see a wig, I wasn't allowed to feel the hair. I carry wipes and sanitizer in my purse at all times, so I was thoroughly offended when she said I would make it dirty. Maybe offer sanitation? The people I talked to, except for one girl, also looked at me blankly whenever I spoke to them. Why, you ask? Because they didn't speak English. I watched them ring up a customer by snatching her product from her hands, ringing it up, telling her the total, and completed the sale without making eye contact. She was AA, and I felt they may have a race issue since I was treated as such. I'm Asian, White, and AA, so they dropped the ball there by jumping the gun. They only have Asian employees, and they weren't knowledgeable about the hair I questioned them on. When you travel to BSS locations on the east side, they are Asian owned and AA operated because they KNOW THE PRODUCT. I would suggest hiring some AA employees if you want to expand your business to the people that shop at these stores most. I will not be coming back here.

What's more is even though I was in the store requesting an exchange on day 14 they count the day I received the phone, even though late that Saturday evening and despite the fact there was a holiday during this period, as day one.\n\nTwo weeks ago today I decided to leave Verizon with whom I have been reasonably satisfied except for cost, and explore other options. I have had a cellphone for 28 years and have, at one time or another, been with all of the major carriers. Two Saturdays ago I went to T-Mobile, AT&T and finally Sprint. On my way to this store I read the Yelp! reviews and thought to myself \"they can't really be THAT bad, can they?\" I've since discovered they are WORSE.\n\nInitially I was very satisfied with the sales process. I actually went online the day before and reserved phones, chose my plan, etc. I was a bit miffed that online I was told I qualified for three lines with no deposit but in store and after \"further review\" that I could only get two lines with a $50 deposit for each. I couldn't understand why as Verizon required no deposit from me two years ago and if anything my credit has improved somewhat sice but whatever. (When I received a letter from Sprint a week later it stated the phone number I provided could not be verified in public records. Are you kidding me? Guess I should have used my landline number. Oh well live and learn.) Because of this SNAFU the sales associate had to basically redo everything in the system so my time spent online was for naught but you can't fault an employee for crappy systems.\n\nNext day when I unboxed the phone and after charging it (even though I was told they are shipped to the store fully charged) and giving it a test drive I noticed a faint crackling static noise while streaming videos on YouTube. Initially I dismissed this as possibly being a fault with the video or possibly bad data connection but several days later while messing with ringtone options the same crackling static noise was there. As this was an HTC One M8 Harman Kardon edition and the main selling point was the superior audio quality I assumed getting a quick like-for-like exchange wouldn't be an issue. Wow was I wrong.\n\nAfter a lengthy back and forth with two different associates, one of whom the same person who sold me the phone, I was told that because it was now, by their strictest application of their policy, outside the14 day return policy, my only option was a refurbished phone through the insurance company. Really? One day and as I mentioned  earlier one of those days was a holiday during which no business could be transacted. Also this came after I was told by a member of their tech department there was nothing wrong with the phone and it was only after I demonstrated using the ringtones that they begrudgingly admitted there was indeed an issue. When I asked if I could appeal to a manager they informed me they were both managers and that nothing more could be done. When pressed a bit more , however, the assistant store manager was summoned. At last, I thought, someone who is empowered to make a customer happy. Wrong, again.\n\nHe introduced himself as Chuck and initially was upbeat and positive. Progress perhaps. I introduced myself as Charlie, plead my case, and he proceeded to tap away at the computer terminal. Good sign. Then he asked to see my phone again. He then proceeded to tell me had the phone been in like new condition perhaps he could have given me some leeway but since there was a gouge on the back of the phone that walking out of the store with a replacement was not an option. I wish I could take and post a picture of this\"gouge\" which is actually a minute abrasion of the plastic backing which you'd need a micrometer to measure. At this point in time and knowing he was fishing for any excuse not to help me I became exasperated. At the very same time Chuck became a first class prick. Very unprofessional.\n\nI intend to send an email to corporate but I'm sure it will only resort in positive feedback to the employees at this store for towing the company line. \"No waivers, no favors.\" So now I don't even have the option of cancellation without massive contract break fees. Be on notice, Sprint and the employees of the Town and Country store, on Monday there will be a call made to the AZ Attorney General's office as well as the Better Business Bureau about your lousy intractable business practices.", "business_id": "N6ff0yyo9Cv_7XPz-YDoow", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-12-27", "type": "review"}

They have anything and everything you could ever want. The thing that gets me with Target is the catchy marketing and packaging of just about everything in the store.

This store, I've noticed, is much cleaner than other stores in the Valley, and the checkouts are always flowing smoothly. Customer service here is great as well.  \n\nI haven't done too much food shopping here. I've noticed that many name brand items are seemingly discounted, and while they don't carry the inventory of an actual grocery store, they carry many, many varieties of the items they do have. Chime in: brilliant packaging. \n\nThe only beef I have with Target is the terrible addiction that overcomes me when I step inside.

Shortly afterwards, I started doing research for best record stores in the 'Burgh, starting with the reviews right here on Yelp. Jerry's came up first. \n\nThe reviews for Jerry's sounded like my kinda place. My only worry was that it's located in Squirrel Hill and I was fearing some kind of godawful traffic jam heading up 376 over the weekend, but luckily it wasn't a game day and nothing else was going on in the city, so it was smooth sailing up to exit 74. Just a hop off the interstate, a left turn, and then another left and then blammo! There's Jerry's in all its glory.\n\nI was actually nervous and excited driving up to it. I can't say I've been excited about going into a record store in ages, but the reviews made the place sound awesome. So in I went, climbing up the steps to the second floor. Man, those steps have quite the degree of incline to 'em.\n\nI walk into the first little room and it's cluttered. Awesome. So I squeeze past the couple of employees going through some new stuff and into the main room. It was like heaven opened up. So many records. Where does one begin? \n\nI checked out the most popular stuff up front first, then quickly ditched that idea and just jumped into the deep end. A Greg Kihn album first, then a Re-Flex LP, some Robert Palmer and Steely Dan that I never had on vinyl, and on it went. I'd keep remembering tings to look for, and go rushing about.\n\nAnd then I tried my best to browse the 45s, but it was too overwhelming. Then I discovered the classical section, and the huge room devoted to jazz LPs, and the huge comedy selection. When did it end? How many records were in this place? Like other reviewers have stated, if you love vinyl, you're gonna spend a ton of time in here just looking and looking and looking. And Jerry was playing some great tunes to shop to as well, so that's always a plus.\n\nI was in there almost two hours and I could have stayed longer. I spent 30 bucks on my finds. As I handed my cash to Jerry, he told me to remember to check out the basement section located downstairs right next door. \"Lots of good rock records in there for a buck,\" he told me. My mind imploded.\n\nI walked downstairs and back outside and pondered visiting the basement, but I decided to save that for the next time. If I hadn't had more shopping to do that day, I would have gone in and lost even more time and money in the best way I could ever imagine. \n\nI got home and all my records were in impeccable shape and sounded amazing. Having vinyl again reminds me of when I was a kid and would buy records and would just sit around and listen to them all the way through, looking at the covers and reading the lyrics sheets if they were included, and just listening. I haven't had that experience in a long time. It's easy to forget after years of CDs and mp3s on shuffle all the time. I'm definitely going to be a customer of Jerry's for the long haul. Definitely the most amazing record store I've ever visited.", "business_id": "sJ0IiEvM--BRApoyAQ51cw", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-12-08", "type": "review"}

I was called a bitch as I was pulling out of the drive thru!!! Unacceptable! Here's the story:  I got a script filled for my son's Epi pen. The doctor PURPOSELY wrote the prescription out for 2 twin packs so I get a total of 4 pens. We need 4 pens (one for school, both parents, and grandparents. The person who took the script said they didn't have it in stock so they would have to order it. I made sure to ask to confirm that I would receive 4 and she said yes. I also asked her to call me when it came in and she said sure. \n\nTwo days later, I didn't hear from them, but I had to fill another prescription and checked if it was there. Sure enough, it was. Did I get a call, no. But that was the least of the issues...\n\nI come back a couple hours later because I decided to pick both of them up at the same time. By the time I got there, it was 9:40. I picked up my meds and waited in the parking lot to meet my boyfriend. I was bored and interested to see what the epi pen looked like so I opened the bag only to find that there was ONE two pack instead of 2 two packs. So I pull back into the drive thru and a different pharmacist comes to the window. I tell him I'm supposed to get 2-2 packs. He pulls out the epi pens and counts two. I say yes, I'm supposed to get TWO- two packs. He tells me that it's one minute till ten (closing time) and they are backed up. In order to fix my prescription he would have to delete the order, get a manager's approval, and then retype the order. I just looked at him as if to say go ahead. He left and the girl that gave me the meds earlier comes back. She tells me if I were to get the second pack, I would have to pay a co pay of $70 because I can only use the manufacturer coupon once. I read the coupon and it says I can use it up to three times. She then says that they don't have it in stock. I say that I'll come back when it's in, but can I at least have the epi pens that are right there? She tells me she doesn't think the coupon will work if she bills it twice. So I say fine, but I need it before Monday so I bring it to the school nurse on the first day of school. She says it will for sure be here. I say okay and pull away from the drive thru. As she is hanging up the phone, I hear her say, \"She's such a bitch.\" \n\nI am appalled and am never coming back after my epi pens get here. I am also going to speak to manager about this issue. Yes, it was right before closing, but if they had the order right the first time, they would be able to close on time. They should not take it out on the customer that just wants medication in the event a child goes into anaphylactic shock. Is that too much to ask for?

We all know their clothing is constructed of fabric which is one step up (or down) from a Bounty paper towel, and no doubt crafted by children with bloated bellies chained to rusty sewing machines in a rat-infested, third world sweatshop (ok I'm just guessing on that last part. But a lot of the seams aren't that straight.). The point is, most of the crap they sell falls apart after a few washings, but that's fine for their demographic, which is younger women and girls on a budget who want cute clothes that they will tire of after a few wearings anyway, so no harm, no foul.\n\nThis review is of the company and their business practices. \n\nI purchased a gift card for Forever 21 from the rack at a Lowe's, and one for Sephora. I put them away, and when I went to wrap them for my daughter, they were gone. I have a creepy feeling I might have accidentally thrown away the bag. Yikes!\n\nSo, I returned to Lowe's, where they scanned my receipt, found the serial numbers for the cards, and gave me the 800 numbers to call the companies. (5 stars, Lowe's)!\n\nThen, I called Sephora, who checked and found that the card had not been used, cancelled it, and sent me a new one (5 stars, Sephora).\n\nThen, I called Forever 21, who checked, found the card had not been used, cancelled it. assured me no one could use it, but COULD NOT ISSUE A REPLACEMENT! WTF??!!  They KNOW the card was paid for, they KNOW they got my money, the KNOW no one can use the card, but I'm supposed to be satisfied with giving them money for nothing? I was outraged. Their website had no address to write to (guess they must be tired of hate mail), but had a \"customer service \" (HA!) contact e-mail address, which apparently is even easier to ignore... No one ever replied. \nAvoid this company like the plague that they are.", "business_id": "cBIqi2BsPjkGko1Dy55FgQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-09-23", "type": "review"}

Also, they were great about having my dress pressed before I picked it up the day before my wedding. \n\nSince I got my dress they have moved into a MUCH smaller location.

The store is the same as every other REI I have shopped at, full of toys, some over prices, some not. Standard. But the bike shop is a place to be wary of. I brought my mountain bike in to have it tuned and the rear wheel trued. Paperwork filled out, I left the bike with the promise it would be done in a couple days. That night I received a phone call from the store's head mechanic. He had bad news, the bike would need a overhaul - an additional $100 bucks on top of the tune- plus a new rear wheel. Now, I have put several hundred miles on the bike so neither sounded outlandish, so I gave him the green light. Later in the week I received another call, this time I needed a new rear derailleur, rear shock, and bottom bracket, all of which he could easily order for me. Convenient. Short on cash, and now suspicious of the mechanic's true motivation - particularly after I had replaced the BB just a month prior - I declined. Later, I received the final call that the bike was ready, and I drove in to pick it up. Of course the mechanic was \"out for the day\" - he was always out - so I did not notice that he had put my rear shock on backwards, failed to fill it with air, failed to properly tune the rear derailleur, and had cut a much to long piece of tubing for the front brake. \n\nI have yet to find a good bike mechanic in Vegas, but be warned that this guy is in the business of selling new parts, not fixing bikes.", "business_id": "QWM4xfjd4WCx_Ci2UG-i3A", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-02-12", "type": "review"}

I went to get a new water filter for a PUR water filter unit.  The first time I came in I did not think it would be a big deal.  \n\nI bought with me the old filter thinking that would work.  The guy said he did not see one that was the same and could not read the part# but that I should have actually bought the unit itself in.\n\nMy thoughts were you have to be kidding however I politely left.  A week later I came it with the water filter refill unit, and the actual water unit itself.  The guy asked me if the facet was a male or a female.  I really thought he was joking. But he insisted saying I might need an adaptor.  I replied, this unit works on my facet you should be able to guess.  Nope, he wanted me to take a picture of the hole in the facet so he could tell if it was male or female.\n\nRound 3 - I came in with both the unit and the old filter and my camera showing the hole in the facet.  Now I am told by the guy that they no longer carry this unit and I had  2 people look  on line to see if I could order the filter and was told no place they look carried it.  They suggested I try Walmart or go on line.\n\nI actually gave up on getting a water filter and threw out the water filter only to find about 2 weeks later while at one of their competitors L**s that they had the water filter the exact same one I threw away and not only that but carried refill filters so I purchased a brand new water filter and a box of 4 filter that would fit.\n\nIn all fairness I hope this is an isolated incident however can you actually believe this is not a sitcom??\n\nI also find this particular store toooo dog friendly. I have seen dogs not on leashes more than once while shopping here.  I personally am not into dogs and with all the vicious occurrences and mauling's I find it hard to believe that the honchos allow this and hope if such an occurrence happens in the store they get their butts sued not that will help the victim.

A meat department with someone working the counter that knows the difference between 80/20 and 94/6. And oh yes, speedy checkouts and self-checkout options. Kroger owns Smith's and while they might just be the second largest Grocery chain in America these days behind WalMart, they kick WalMart's rear end more often than not. Kroger has been a \"FULL SERVICE GROCER\" for a long time, and they still know how to do it right. \n\nAlso for those who want to try their hand at extreme couponing, while Nevada doesn't have the double coupon deals like some states have, Smith's has helped me maximize my budget between my coupons and their sales and 10 for 10 deals.

Checkout is the place where you cool your heels, don't go there in a hurry. \nFresh & Easy: Small selection, slightly higher prices, seen produce and meat quality issues here.

They should have moving sidewalks or trams to get you around the store.  I can see why they sell hotdogs and pizza out in front by the entrance.  It's so you can carb up for your pilgrimage across the aisles.  Okay, now that, that is out of the way.  I want to preface this review on one thing.  I know absolutely nothing, and I mean nothing, about home repair.  I can work a plunger.  That stuff scares me... Well except electrical work - for some reason I don't mind messing around with wires, that can electrocute me.  Sorry... I digress.  This place is great for the do-it-yourselfer's.  The weekend warriors that like to gussy up their home with the latest in home care.  I am not one of those people.  But, if I were to choose to become one, this place would be awesome.  Anyhow, here is the reason I came in today with my actual review.\n\nFor the last couple of days I have been looking for 2 amp slo-blo fuses.  Go ahead and laugh about SLO-BLO.  If you are finished I can continue.  Anyhow, I came in looking for these fuses for a few Fender Amplifiers that I am putting together.  I have tried everywhere... Well - not really everywhere - I tried Radio Shack, and they didn't have them.  So, my next step was to call Home Depot then Frye's.  I was hoping Home Depot had them because this store is close to where I live.  So, I called first to see if they had the fuses.  I hate calling places with automated messaging.  It takes so long to figure out what dept. I want and then get someone on the line.  I eventually got through and was transferred to electronics and was helped by, I think his name was Bill.  Don't hold me to that name.  And, he looked in his inventory and said they had the fuses.  Even though, I was still skeptical, I came in the store.  I got to the electronics section and low and behold, they had my fuses.  They cost more than what I am accustomed to through Amazon or Fender.  I was happy!  One, for not having to drive across town and two, for being able to get my amps in working order.\n\nSo, I am a fan... Who knows?  Maybe, if I decide to become a do-it-yourselfer, I'll come back here for all of my needs. \n\nI took a star off for the automated machine.", "business_id": "c7XjwdQ-bGdaOreq4gdgZg", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-04-17", "type": "review"}

I bought my MOH dress here, chosen by my sister from afar. Thaqt expereince was horrible.. \n\nBut this time around I decided to give David's another try because I'm the BRIDE. I figured maybe I had received backseat service because I was a lowly attendent.. Nope. Brides are just as cattle driven as attendents. \n\nI called 4 days in advance to book myself an appointment for the following weekend. I invited a couple friends and as soon as we walked in the store I was hit by the sheer amount of people in there.. It was jam packed. I overlooked this, as I knew I'd made an appointment and assumed I'd receive the service I had booked. \n\nI did.. SORT of. My consultant informed me immediately that she was also helping another bride, so she would pull me some dresses and be \"around\" to answer any questions or help out. (Fine, whatever. I have my friends for that.) \n\nBefore I booked my appointment I saved six dresses to their website which the consultant was able to print out and use to pull the specific dresses. She managed to pull four of the six, two of which were not even close to my size. She supplied a clip for the back, but these things were literally EIGHT sizes too large for me, so clipping the back did the dresses no justice at all. \n\nThe other two dresses she said she thought they just didn't have. Annoyed, my friend asked her to look again, as one of them was the one I wanted to try on most. Funny, after requesting a second time, the consultant came up with the dress which ended up being my number one pick. I loved it and would have liked to try it with a veil and some accessories.. Heck, I would have loved to see it on the platform area with all the big mirrors (I was only alotted the mirror on the back of the dressing room door), but I was then informed that we had 15 minutes left, so if we'd like to see any other dresses it's now or never. I was shocked.. I had no idea there was a time limit for brides looking for their dresses and was really disappointed that we had no time to look through dresses ourselves.

I got through five dresses, much of the time spent was simply waiting for the next to arrive from my obviously overbooked and frazzled consultant. \n\nThe draw - and only reason I gave 2 stars instead of one- to David's is the price range; they carry many affordable dresses and even have offshoot lines of some famous makers (White by Vera Wang, melissa sweet, etc but these are more like outlet lines by the makers). However, you will pay for it in service. Because you won't really experience any. If all of the other shops are out of your price range, I'm sorry you'll have to deal with David's.

I will NEVER shop here again. This is NOT a true Verizon store.  They're a FRANCHISE store that only purchases products from Verizon and re-sells them on Verizon's network. Their RULES and Verizon's TRUE stores have a different set of rules as far as returns and warranties go, etc...\n\nToday I attempted to return a product that was sold to me under false pretenses. I have a Pacemaker/Defibrillator and purchased this product to use with my medical device, so they could check it remotely.  I don't think that it was done INTENTIONALLY, at least I HOPE it wasn't done intentionally, but  after today I'm starting to wonder.\n\nThis week I had an appt where I was told what I had purchased will not work with ANY medical devices. These devices transfer data (via the Fax theory) and these wireless home phone devices don't work like that. When I tried to return it., UNOPENED & UNUSED, the manager called 911 on me, AFTER I had agreed to ANY charges he had to charge me for taking back the product.  But I'm just not paying for something for 2 years that I not only don't really need, but that the product doesn't do what I NEED it to do. I don't know about you, but I can't afford to pay for something that is actually WORTHLESS to me.  He tried to intimidate me with all these re-stocking fees as well as his threats of my losing another discount, on something else etc... When that didn't work, he made the decision to call 911 on me for telling him \"Then he could KEEP the sonofabitch\". I said that immediately after he REFUSED to take it back and told me there's NOTHING he's going to do to help me. At that point I picked up the box, moved it to the other side of the counter... DROPPED the box... (it dropped hard but was NOT SLAMMED), when I said... \"You can keep the sonofabitch then!\"  Let me also note that there was no one else in the store, just me., so I did not make a scene in front of any other customers.  Next thing I know he's telling  me to \"...leave the store or he'd call the cops\". Not being intimidated by a \"CELLPHONE SALESMAN\", I told.him I wasn't going anywhere until I get this handled. (I was also on hold with \"Verizon Customer Service\" at the time, who had previously TOLD me (20 mins earlier) to take it back to the store and if I had ANY problems returning it to call them from the store where they could speak to the manager) In the meantime the manager (Zach) decides to CALL 911 and in about 5 minutes, 3-5 cops show up, while I'm still on hold sitting in a chair not saying a word! The cops walk in and ask him what the problem was, and he tells them I was throwing stuff around and cursing at him. When I chimed in to the cop and said... \"I'm a real problem over here huh?  ONE of the 5 of the \"Doughnut Brigade\", decided he was going to try to GOAD me into something so he could cuff me. I didn't fall for his trap, so the hairlip didn't get his satisfaction\n\nBut the bottom line on this issue is that this manager didn't want to deal with the problem and due to his LACK of \"Customer Service\" skills, he called the Police on a customer who had been with Verizon less than 30 days, with 3 OTHER devices connected to my account. So, for a couple of bucks, he chose to piss off a BRAND NEW CUSTOMER, that very easily could've LEFT Verizon cuz AT&T, T-mobile and Sprint are ALL paying early termination fees. AT&T's begging me to come back.\n\nVERIZON corporate itself was GREAT! They ended up working with me and decided it was better to make a customer happy over a couple dollars than it was to call the COPS on him. VERIZON itself is WONDERFUL and took care of the problem IMMEDIATELY. Even they were appalled at this guy calling the cops. I will continue to be a Verizon Customer...  \n\nBut BEWARE!!! This store is NOT a Verizon Store. They're a bunch shysters selling products under Verizon's name, that ARE NOT BEHOLDEN to Verizon's Corporate Rules, Policies and Business Standards! Instead take the time and travel ACROSS I-10 to the CORPORATE Verizon Store on 54th Street in Chandler.  But do yourself a favor and PLEASE STEER CLEAR of this store! You'll be sorry if you don't...

It is not my grocery store of choice, but they do have more fruits and veggies than the Fresh and Easy I usually go to. \n\nStill, I don't know about this place. The parking is always a mess for whatever reason. The meat counter is good, and the staff is pretty helpful. Prices seem kinda high, but also I'm cheap. The layout of this place seems off, but I can't figure it out.\n\nUltimately this place leaves me unimpressed, and if I return it's more of a convenience thing than anything.", "business_id": "rbcco9u9YO6jnaZtv7RIPw", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-06-03", "type": "review"}

Unfortunately, I know nothing about vaping.\n\nAfter checking out reviews and scanning through the photos for local vape businesses, I decided that this was the place I wanted to go to and purchase his new vape. It also helped that it was so close to where we lived so he could just drive on over if he had any questions or needed more juice.\n\nI walked in and was greeted by all of their team members, with Marcus stepping out to assist me. I explained what my plan was and also that I knew nothing about vaping. He asked me all of the standard questions: what kind of vape does he have now, how often does he vape, how much of a hit he wants to get, etc. He showed me their selection and also how to build it up. I have to thank him for being so patient with me because I kept wanting to see this mod, with this tank, and this with that (it went on like this for awhile because I get indecisive). After some time, I decided on the Stingray X Mod in silver with copper accents (in their photos) with the new Aspire Atlantis Sub Ohm Tank. Marcus advised that it will give my boyfriend good hits that are similar to a drip tip. Now that he has his gift, I asked him if this was true and he said that it was! I also got him batteries and a charger as well so that he would have everything. Be sure to check in on Yelp and show them for a 10% discount!\n\nThank you Vapology, my boyfriend loves his gift!", "business_id": "LJn4M--YqLN5JC8ehxl14g", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-12-31", "type": "review"}

My holy grail is to find a Chanel here, but until then, I can only dream.  It's funny how I heard about this place.  My mom told me that her client visits Last Chance whenever she's in Arizona.  As fate may have it, now I'm dating someone from Arizona. \n\nLast Chance is where all the Nordstrom Rack stuff that can't sell comes in or stuff that is damaged needs to be sold.  I was shocked to find out how very cheap some stuff is here.  Of course, they have special days with additional discounts, but the stuff here is already deeply discounted.  From what I remember, they had boxes and boxes of designer bags, albeit damaged in some way: broken zipper, rips, stains, etc.  Expect it to be crowded on weekends, I'd recommend going on a weekday.  The parking lot is always packed!  They have security here and for good reason.  When a worker brings out new merchandise in the shoe area, in a gray trashbin, they are accompanied by  security guards and it's also cordoned off with caution tape.  Every time new merchandise comes in, the worker needs protection, but God only knows what will happen if there wasn't any.  Safety is priority..who wants to get trampled on? Not me, nor the people who work here.  I've seen women get into verbal fights and grabbing.  Watch your carts because you never know.\n\nI've found some gems like an Andrew Marc coat, missing the belt, for only $30, retail $695; Treesje purse $90, retail +500!  The best deals, in my opinion, are the purses and the shoes.  Racks and racks of shoes, most of them have been refurbished with two drill holes on the bottom.  They are perfectly fine, but if you don't mind that, you can get real steals.  \n\nAlso, it's worth noting, that there are limits on how many items in each section you can buy per day.  Perhaps to perturb those people who want to sell on eBay, etc.  All in all, hit and miss, but the hunt is what makes me come back.", "business_id": "Nj6ITW0Zhl7LpovGIH6SAg", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-03-28", "type": "review"}
