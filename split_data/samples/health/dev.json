I workout often and have a lot of muscle soreness in addition to stress. She was able to target all of my trouble spots and stretch my limbs. I could tell she has been doing this for years and really knows the body. She is extremely talented. I too have been searching for a regular, affordable massage therapist and I now found one. As OZ. said, Millie is very sweet and caring as well. The products did smell wonderful as well and the heated towels and warm table added to the experience. 90 minutes was great. I typically do 60, but 90 is really the best as you can relax and really allow her to do her magic. It's not a fancy spa, but it's ver clean and zen enough for me. Music, scented oils, nice room.

I like how I can choose the extremeness of the heat as one side of the room is hotter than the other.  Don't get me wrong.  It's hot.  Just that one side has the humidifiers on it and it can be REALLY hot near them.  The room has good air circulation and it doesn't get too stuffy and I feel like I can breathe.\n\nBikram yoga is the only exercise I've found that I can really stick with.  Even with working 12-hour shifts I can find the time.  I don't feel right unless I go.  It gives me a clearer mind, clearer skin and clearer sight.  I have more energy and I only feel like eating healthy foods.  I sleep better and have less back pain.

Ok where to begin...this is going to be long.  If you are lazy, find summation in last paragraph.  \n\nA while back I needed a reasonable amount of work done.  The office clerk, told me the charges (which at the time seemed a bit high) but I paid.  Finally I decided to check with my insurance company, and found out that they were billing me more than they needed to.  Armed with this knowledge at my next visit (the work was half done so I had no choice but to return) before I could mention the error they told me \"the doc is having a special you can get your fillings for half off\" (something to this effect).   Oh a holiday special, SURE.  I knew that this was the amazing credit that was sitting on my account that they wanted to use up instead of refunding me my money.  NO thanks, refund please.  Issue #1\n\nHaving no luck looking for a dentist from my friends/family/coworkers, I didn't want to neglect my teeth completely waiting for a reasonable alternative.  I went back to finish out the major work that needed to be done (my fault) which took about 2 more visits.....or so one would think.  I needed a crown.  However, the company the office dealt with, got my crown incorrect, not one, but TWO times.   Ok 2 times, no big deal eh?  Well, for each time they got it wrong, I had to go in and get the tooth template (I'm sure it isn't called that) done AND then go in again so they could tell me it didn't fit.  And I'm a busy person so 4 unnecessary visits are not my cup of tea. Issue #2\n\nFinally, we had a winner.  After my final visit, I was pretty fed up.  I was definitely in the \"glue this sucker on and let me go so I never have to see you people again\"....mode.  I can't remember but I think I mentioned never coming back (my fault again).  \n\nA couple of months later, out of the blue, I received a bill from them.   Weird.  I looked and noticed that it was for a no show.  Scooby says ERR?  No show for what?  I WENT to my LAST appointment.  What is this charge for?  I thought, okay, they haven't really been the best with accounts in the past, I'm sure they'll realize they charged the wrong person eventually.   My fault AGAIN for not calling them IMMEDIATELY.  June comes and I get a notice from a collection company.  WTF!?!   I called the office and Lucille says \"oh this is for a no show\".  Ok, sure, it says that on the bill.  What I am telling you is that I NEVER planned on returning, so I KNOW, I wouldn't have made an additional appointment.  Her response was \"I will have to talk to the doctor\".

Suuuuuurrrreeee he does.  Remind me again when that appointment \"I made\"  was.....she says \"February 3rd\".  Uh huh... it is now July.   I call bullshit.  Issue #3\n\nWhy o why did I go back?  Laziness, optimism, naivet\u00e9, belief that everyone should have a second chance, or maybe just the belief that they really couldn't be this terrible...could they?  I know that I should have walked away after issue #1, so shame on me.  But shame on them too!

Still, my wife got glasses and I got a refill of my contacts, with a modified prescription.  Initially all seemed OK, but not too long after I started to need reading glasses to see smaller print.  I figured it was just a normal progression of my eyesight, as that is a common development for most over time.  My wife started getting headaches if she wore her glasses for very long.  She thought that was just a case of adjusting as she hadn't worn glasses, other than reading glasses, before.\n\nNot being happy with the feel of this office, this year we went to a different provider.  The experience was much better, to start.  But, then, we found that the prescriptions of my wife's glasses and my contacts were not correct.  It seems quite unlikely that it was due to changes in our eyes.  The prescription for my wife's glasses was too strong, not too weak, and her eyes did not improve during the past year.  She has new glasses now and her vision is much, much better. \n\nIn my case, with the correct prescription for my contacts, I no longer need reading glasses for most things, and again, the prescription is not as strong as before.\n\nWe are very happy with the new provider and feel we were just a customer to get in and out for this provider.", "business_id": "SsWoxazfkRznqvNcBX-hDw", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-05-30", "type": "review"}

But when it came time to find a new optometrist...I looked at my provider services guide, and then I turned to Yelp to give me the details the provider guide didn't. Yelp helped me narrow down my choices to two. The first choice was closer to where I live but they were so rude that they got a bad review of their own. But my second choice...turned out to be my best choice and that is Clearvision Southwest. \n\nFrom the time I walked in the door I was greeted with a smile. The forms were short, the paperwork easy to read. I was able to see Dr. Wong within 10 minutes of my appointment time which always impresses me. And while they were having some web based computer glitches today, the rest of the office was equipped with up to date equipment...including testing equipment that didn't freak me out. (The one machine that puffs air at your eyes...Dr. Wong's machine didn't freak me out like other equipment has in the past!)\n\nDr. Wong took the time to listen...and I say that because she caught something my previous optometrist had done and that is to slightly over-correct my vision. When I peppered her with questions she took the time to answer. And even though I had pushed my contacts a bit hard of late, she didn't give me a hard time over it. And one more very important thing. She smiles. You don't feel like line #39 on a daily patient spreadsheet, you can see she gets it, and she does care about what's going on with your eyes. \n\nThe front office staff can make or break a practice, and Dr. Wong has Rhonda running the front. She's very knowlegeable, she tells it like it is, and she's able to help you make the best choices to maximize your insurance coverage. I did not feel pressured into making any high cost purchases, and from start to finish I was listened to and treated with respect. \n\nIt has been many, many years since I had an eye care experience like the one I had with Dr. Wong and Rhonda at ClearVision. But...it won't be my last. I look forward to taking my family there and I don't see a need to look any further...I've found my eye care professional in Vegas. \n\n4 Very Strong Stars. So why not 5? I've tightened my guidelines for reviews and star counts.

My regular dr was a week out taking appts and my husband and I both were coughing and having flu like symptoms.  Plus I had a work event I wanted to attend and didn't want to miss it so I was not going to wait this thing out.  So 5 minute wait after paying the usual co-pay I would have at my regular dr. The Physician Assistant was professional, thorough, kind and to the point.  No weigh in or measuring my blood pressure or my height which of course adds time to the appt but fine by me.  They just ask me to provide the stats.  They do check temperature.  It's also convenient because they'll zip the prescription to the pharmacy inside the Fry's, but we had to wait over 45 mins for our prescription to be filled after being promised a 30 min wait so that was the only downer. Just come back or use another pharmacy.  I will definitely go here next time for a quick diagnosis and when I know I just need an antiobiotic instead of going to my regular dr who makes me wait 30-45 mins before calling me back. Another plus+ is they are open on weekends.

I had my very first colonoscopy at age 62 last week.  I m a veteran and the VA is now referring patients out to private practices for procedures they are not equipped to do, of which a colonoscopy is one.  The VA sent me a list of several local providers to choose from, and frankly the reviews of most were not that great.   I liked the most recent review on Yelp for Dr. Gandotra, and was very pleased with the overall experience with his group clinic, Elite Endoscopy on Smoke Ranch in Las Vegas.  I will say that it was very difficult to reach his staff initially, but once I was in touch with them after the first two weeks of trying to get through to them the communication was excellent and the care provided by his team was very good. I must say his office is very busy, with patients lined up about ten deep in the waiting room.  However, after about an hour wait you will be processed pretty quickly.  Dr. Gandotra has a pleasant and knowledgeable attitude, having done over 10,000 procedures!  The day of my colonoscopy I arrived at the scheduled time of 7:30am, and waited about an hour to get to the back area where the procedures are done.  The only hiccups were that I specified (3 times) not to call my pick up ride before 10:30am, but that request was miscommunicated, as the nurses use the computer for calling info rather than the sheet that is written on during the intake process.  Also the nurse who put in my IV was not very good, as it hurt badly, and continued to hurt for quite a while after.  There was a lot of blood that \"contaminated\" the sheets, and I was told their laundry delivery hadn't arrived that day, so they just seemed to fold the bloody sheet area underneath me and kept moving along. I've had many IV's before while donating blood, and only one other bad experience like this.  There is a professional anesthesiologist on staff who seems quite good also. Once in the procedure room I was given a dose of Propofol, which instantly put me out.  After the procedure was done (about 50 minutes) I was tapped on the shoulder and told to wake up.  I awoke right away, feeling fully alert and refreshed.  That Propofol is amazing!  They do process about 20 patients a day there or more, so it was quite busy, kind of an assembly line atmosphere, but no problems other than the ones mentioned.   The nurse gives you a very short report on the procedure results and then tells you they will contact you for a follow-up appointment at the doctor's patient office on W. Charleston. Overall I would highly recommend this doctor and his staff. The worst part of it all was the bowel prep.  See if you can find something that doesn't require you to drink 7 pounds of liquid the night before! There has been no pain or discomfort of any sort after the procedure, although it may take a couple of days for you to use the bathroom again.", "business_id": "iJF4nk1kxLjcjW3pi_FaVA", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-05-06", "type": "review"}

The first time was to see her colleague who has since departed the practice.  I actually met the doctor in her office first, rather than in the exam room.  Clothed!  Me, not her.  Well both of us actually.  \n\nI did find the check-in process inefficient.  They give you a clunky electronic tablet to complete what is normally done on paper.  But you don't complete all your information on the tablet.  Instead, they rattle off a bunch of instructions about which parts to skip because they collect some of your info on paper.  I couldn't remember what she said by the time I got to that part.\n\nAs I specifically chose a physician that did not practice obstetrics hoping to minimize all the scheduling problems created by uncooperative fetuses, I was surprised by a long wait.\n\nBy the time I needed to return, that physician had left the practice.  For \"convenience,\" I asked to see Dr. Wilson.  I was scheduled with a nurse practitioner, Robin, instead.  Robin was fantastic, and I can only say good things about her.\n\nUnfortunately, I cannot say the same for the staff.  I was not advised that I would be seen at a different office than my previous visit.  The receptionist was about as unprofessional as it gets.  She couldn't even speak to me because she was too busy eating a Snickers bar.  Several employees spent more time laughing and talking hair color than actually working.  But at least they were getting paid to waste time.  I had another 45 minute wait.  When I was finally freed, the Snickers spokesperson watched me wait to check out at the back counter for at least 5 minutes before she asked if I needed help.  But my chart wasn't where it should be, so even that was delayed.    \n\nSo 5 stars for Robin and 1 star for everything else.  If you do decide to take your chances and want to see Dr. Wilson personally, confirm who you are scheduled to see.  Both times I called asking for an appointment with Dr. Wilson, but was not scheduled with her.

I can't tell you how silly it is to pack up your child to run to an independent lab to do lab work.  Never grew up that way, so it's completely wacky to me when I have to pack a sick child up to go somewhere else to do lab work.\n\nOur pediatrician is Dr. Tacvorian whom is completely old school and I totally appreciate it.  We also had a chance to see Dr. Baker whom is awesome and sat down with us to talk about our child with no regard to time.  I think he spent like 20-30 minutes just chatting on how to take care of him.

Very patient with our son and he never cried with her when doing blood work.   Some of the others are completely impatient and squeeze their little foots until the infants cry out and claim that it's always like that.\n\nI'll also say that I'm not sure about the hygiene at this clinic.  They have Purell dispensers but it's hard to tell if people actually use them.  I know that my son had peed on the floor out of fright after having to get his weight checked and we got some paper towels from the CNA, but unsure that it was ever actually cleaned up later that day.  Definitely no one came by with Clorox wipes or anything to wipe after we cleaned it up with the paper towels.\n\nAnother awesome thing about this clinic though is that they are open 7 days a week and able to accommodate sick children by appointment on the weekends with walk-ins from 7-8AM every day.

My two main problems with CORE are \n\n1) it's drive-thru pain management and \n2) AHCCCS patients seem to be treated with lesser care.\n\nHaving said that, I don't have any experience with other pain mgmt clinics to compare and contrast whether they have the same issues. \n\nI was referred here last year because of persistent back pain that I've had since at least 2011. I've had lower back pain since high school, at all kinds of weight--thin, heavy, in between. But it became so bad that I could no longer walk 1 1/2 miles at a time...then 1 mile...and then when it got to 1/2 mile, I went to my primary care physican for help. I was eventually sent to CORE, where I met a spine surgeon. Jesus, what an arrogant asshole. He snarled at me like I was beneath him, told me my problems were all because I was fat, and even WHEN I had an MRI and it showed degenerative disc disease, a bulging disc, and a herniated disc, he exaggerated how VERY SMALL the bulge was and how \"you really SHOULDN'T be in that much pain.\"\n\nExcuse me? Now I'm not allowed to feel pain because it's not worthy of his attention? Seriously? He sent me to physical therapy, which worked at first, and then exacerbated my pain to unbelievable levels. I stuck with it, though, because I kept thinking all I had to do was complete it, and I'd be fixed. Nope. With a great deep sigh, doucheface sent me to a pain doctor.\n\nThis isn't really important, but I should probably warn anyone headed here that most of the doctors look like GQ models. I was startled when my first pain doctor entered the room. I guess I had been expecting an old dude with a croaky voice and I got a mega tall basketball player doc instead. Don't get me wrong, the first doc was nice--but nice isn't what I needed when I could barely walk and my pain was getting so bad I was regularly throwing up and sometimes even passing out from it. I needed efficiency, not small talk and charm. So I began doing steroid epidurals. They didn't help--none of them. I almost felt guilty when he would ask how they helped, and I had to say they didn't, at all.\n\nTime went by, and the first pain doctor transferred to his own practice in another state, so I began seeing the second pain doctor. He was curt and abrupt in the first couple of appointments, but I guess when you deal with fakers every day, you have to separate the wheat from the chaff. He also scolded me about my weight. I gained 60 lbs in 2012 from a medication I was put on, and almost directly afterward, while I was exercising to work it off, my pain began to soar to the point that I sought help. I have a history of eating disorders counting back to middle school, so the topic of weight is extremely sensitive to me. But I am aware that the more weight on a person, the worse the pain and the harder it is for the joints to move.\n\nI continued with the rx regimen and in the meantime, my new primary care physician referred me to a rheumatologist, who confirmed that in addition to degenerative disc disease and the herniated disc, I also have fibromyalgia. I continued with the nerve blocks, but also started Neurontin, hoping that would help both the widespread and lower lumbar pain. The pain in my back persisted, so I opted for radiofrequency ablation; the first done in the beginning of March, and the other done yesterday. My rheumy also discovered I have osteoarthritis in my knees. I've had pain in my knees for years, but I think being heavy was insult to injury (pun intended).\n\nMy pain has been persistently severe enough that I still regularly throw up or pass out. I have relayed this to staff, but I was met with the insistence that the rx regimen I am on now (which is not that high, medication wise, and in relation to other DDD patients I know) is the absolute most I can take. To say that this is frustrating is the understatement of a year. You never know how many little things you can miss until your very ability to walk, work, play sports, and generally function are taken away. I almost feel as if I'm not expressing myself eloquently enough, because the dr and PA smile unblinkingly at me. I understand there's a modicum of professionalism, but I am really suffering, and thank goodness I have faith and positivity, as well as the love of friends and family, bc an ordinary person would really struggle with her sanity in the face of all this pain. And I remember that there are all sorts of people in all sorts of worse situations than I am. It makes sense to be detached in an atmosphere like pain management. But I would appreciate just a little twinge of empathy, just once.\n\nThe new building on 25th Ave is atrocious. The lobby is like a basketball court, with echoing shouts of names from the receptionists and a little store tucked in the corner. The hallways leading to the exam rooms are like something out of The Shining. The building makes me feel small and frail.

I noticed that in Pod D the DAY nurses are a little less attentive and slower to respond to the remote control caller button than the night Pod D nurses were.  \n\nPod C nurses were nicer than Pod D nurses overall, and many of them are friends with each other and attend the same church and even quietly sung some of their church songs together on the night shift, which was very comforting in my opinion.  Pod C nurses were very attentive, quick to respond, were very \"real\" when speaking with me and answering questions, and knew all the ins and outs of getting you the best care from the doctors.  They visited with each other while at the nurses station, that's true, but they rarely got to sit down for more than a few minutes at a time because it was always time for some patient to get some type of attention and it NEVER, EVER ENDS.  \n\nSTOP WHAT YOU ARE DOING RIGHT NOW AND REALIZE THAT NO MATTER WHAT TIME OF NIGHT IT IS -- THE NURSES AT BANNER GOOD SAM ARE GETTING OUT OF THEIR CHAIRS CONSTANTLY TO ATTEND TO SOMETHING A PATIENT NEEDS AND MONITORING THEIR CARE FROM THEIR COMPUTER PROGRAMS AND ARE IN CONSTANT TOUCH WITH THE DOCTORS BY PHONE, GIVING THEM UPDATES.  I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY CAN KEEP ALL THE CHANGING DATA IN THEIR HEADS FROM ALL THE CHANGES WITH EACH PATIENT.  It truly is a constant thing around the clock and I know because I was a day sleeper while I was there and I was awake at all hours of the night, getting my ice chps and walking with my walker for exercise and I saw those nurses constantly attending to the patients at 1:00 a.m., 3:00 a.m., 4:00 a.m.  IT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW.\n\nI agree there is a neverending string of visitors wanting blood, taking blood pressure, dispensing your meds, asking you questions, etc. that starts about 3:00 a.m. and goes thru to about 7:00 a.m.  I almost felt I should \"hold a meeting or press conference\" and have them all appear in my room at once and answer their questions and allow them to poke and prod simultaneously and get it over with so I could go back to sleep.\n\nThere could be better housekeeping efforts in the private bathrooms by the cleaning staff.\n\nIf you find yourself staying at Banner Good Sam for 1 or more nights and are in need of any kind of pain medication (other than the morphine self-pumper - limited of course), then take a tip from me and self-monitor the timing of your doses so that if you are supposed to get your pain pill(s) every four (4) hours, START getting the nurses going on dispensing your meds about 20-40 minutes before that four (4) hours is UP, because it takes them that long to go through all the administrative medical hoops to actually hand you the pills.  If you WAIT until your four (4) hours is UP to ask the nurses for your next round of pain meds, it can take them 20-40 minutes to get it to you by the time they make all the phone calls they need to make, and by then you could be in trouble with PAIN.  I'm surprised that the nurses don't realize this themselves and start getting your next round ready 20-40 minutes BEFORE your four (4) hour interval is up -- but, alas this seems to be up to the patient.  Pod C was better about this than Pod D was BTW.\n\nI only met one Nurse Ratchet, and she was sort of a Semi-Nurse-Ratchet on Pod D -- can't remember her name, but she had that familiar cold stare.\n\nI like the layout of the pods with their circular nurse stations -- they can really keep an eye on the patients that way and they are always at hand, and when you need to do some walking with your walker or IV pole, you can go in circles and still be close to the nurses.  They know which patients haven't done any walking yet, and they congratulate and encourage you when they see you finally up and about!  Also, the ice chip machine is a great find and it dispenses FILTERED water and ice chips -- a Godsend when you are on ice chips and no food for days.  I think the nurses have a running joke about \"Whack-a-Mole\" which describes their constant interruptions during their shift from their patients that surround them in the circular pod.  Being in the center of the pod, the nurses in their nurse station have nowhere to hide from patients!  Those nurses really deserve all our respect and adoration for the CONSTANT care and interruptions they endure with such grace.  \n\nI intend to go back to visit them and thank the ones I remember in person with gifts very soon and I WILL NOT FAIL TO DO THIS AS GOD IS MY WITNESS.  I feel so much better now they may not even recognize me from the pained, dizzy, bloated, hospital-robed, frizzy haired, no-make-up lady they took such good care of for a few days.  I will waltz in there with my hair and makeup done, wearing nice clothes and bearing gifts and hugs very soon!

I am actively loading and unloading 6 hours a day (the other 5-6 hours is driving) needless to say it is an extremely labor intensive job.  \n\nI made my first visit to this location around the end of June at a time when my Plantar Fasciitis was at its worst (the pain in my heel was terrible, I could not walk on it and had tried many healing techniques from youtube, and later found shoes for people with these problems which is what lead me here).  The staff greeted me and my wife as we entered.  I was then taken care of by Matt Key who after hearing my concerns sat me down and proceeded to thoroughly check my feet, and then my gait.  \n\nAfter his initial recommendation I agreed to purchase a pair of shoes which retailed for $145.  I was more concerned with quality and alleviating pain then cost.  Matt even ordered me a bigger size.  It took about a week to get the order.  I returned and tried on the shoes which not only fit perfect, felt extremely comfortable.  I gave them a good break-in period before really seeing what they would do and to my amazement (until now a few months later) have not had any heel pain what-soever!  I was even able to bring the shoes in a month after purchase so they could make sure the wear down was proper and give it any needed adjustments.  \n\nOver all they truly have genuine concern for people with all types of foot problems, they do attend school to learn about the feet and provide the best possible solutions.  While I have heard some stores have not given good service, this location and all it's staff have given me nothing but care, attention, and OUTSTANDING CUSTOMER SERVICE.  \n\nTake it from someone who has had real health issues and major foot problems.

He sent me to Physical Therapy, even though I'd already been once before. PT was excruciating, so I returned to McCoy. He gave me serious narcotics (too strong) and got me an MRI. A week after the MRI, I'd heard nothing back. Called the office and found out the doctor hadn't even read it yet. When he did, he saw a labral tear in the cartilege and sent me to an arthroscopic speciatist. That guy told me that there was no point fixing the tear, I needed a hip replacement. So had to wait for an appointment with good hip surgeon and then wait for surgery date.\n\nI needed a pre-surgical physical and blood tests, which also were ordered through these people. Again, Alice was great. I had everything done 2 weeks before they were due. Again, no response, no feedback on tests. On the Thursday before they were due, I called and was told that they would be marked \"urgent\". Today, the Monday the results were due, I called my surgeon -- no results had been faxed. Turns out they'd been faxing USM the previous Thursday and today too. I called USM and they told me they would mark my request 'urgent'. Ha! Ha! I told them they'd already done that and that I could come down and hand carry the results to my surgeon. I was very irate. They put me on hold, apologized, told me the results had been faxed that day and would be faxed again. We'll see.\n\nThe front desk has been consistently rude and incompetent.

I didn't like the last place I went to, so I decided to try somewhere new, and this place is right across the street from my place.  I called, scheduled an appointment (w/o difficulty), and that was that.\n\nThe facility is HUGE.  They have an aesthetic place inside of it.  It seemed like it took me several turns down several halls just to go to my appointment room.  I was greeted by a front office administrator, checked in, and waited.  I scheduled my appointment as early as I could (8:30 am) so that I didn't have to wait long to be seen.\n\nI was called back immediately and greeted by a very friendly back office MA.  She took my vitals, asked several questions, and was off to get the P.A. (Julia).  I was very impressed with the sincere tone of voice and attitude she had.\n\nJulia came right in, smiles and all, and started at it.  I had several concerns to discuss, and she addressed each one with detail and explanation in terms that made sense to me.  I was provided with several samples to use for my condition and was encouraged to come back in 2 weeks for follow-up.\n\nOne reason that I am iffy on new facilities is because I always feel like they try and \"sell\" you on services.  I got a slight sense of this when I came in.  I wanted to inquire about a full body scan (I have sensitive skin and am at risk of pre-cancerous lesions).  They were adamant about doing it right then and there.  I also had a benign popule under my eyelid, which apparently is considered cosmetic to remove, and they also wanted to have at it in that same visit.  I appreciate them wanting to get it all done, but I didn't have the money up front to throw down for the removal, and wasn't sure how much my insurance would cover for the full body scan.  I opted out this visit to seek this information first.  \n\nIn either case, I definitely recommend this place to anyone.

I asked friends if they had any recommendations and was referred to A Children's Dentist.  I am glad I was given good advice too!  I called to set up my first appointment and it was quite easy.  The lady I spoke with was helpful and friendly.\n\nWhen we arrived for the appointment, we were warmly greeted and promptly taken care of.  My daughter enjoyed the waiting room as well, especially the birds up front.  There is a lot of toys and games to play with and help get the kiddos relaxed and in a good mood before heading back.  \n\nWe were called back within 5 minutes of the appointment time.  The nurse/dental tech (not sure what her title was), was really friendly and good with my daughter.  The nurse explained how children's dental practices are different from adult services and let me know how this appointment would go, as well as future appointments as my daughter gets older.  I appreciated the info and I think it helped my daughter get used to everything in the exam room as well before the doctor came in.\n \nDr. Saxe arrived shortly afterwards and was so delightful.  He explained how the exam would go and helped me get my daughter into the correct position to check her teeth.  He was very calm and relaxing and my daughter really took to him.  He did a great job.  I wish my dentist was this friendly!\n\nSo fast forward to today, and it was even easier this time around.  My daughter seemed more comfortable and relaxed.  She ran in right to the birds while I checked her in.  When we were called back, she went willingly and was happy.  Her exam went smoothly and came back as an A+ for dental health. Yeah for no cavities!\n\nThe check out process is super easy as well.  I also like how they let you make your next appointment right then and not have to worry about it for 6 months.

Had been a few years since my last massage.  More than 5 years ago, when I lived in San Jose, CA,\nI found a great therapist.  Regular visits definitely had a positive impact on my overall health and injury prevention.  Elements is close to where I live in Summerlin, and easily accessible off Rampart/Ft. Apache.  I took advantage of the 1st session discount for new clients and booked a massage.  Great location with plenty of parking and calming interior.  My session started right on time and a slight young woman Joey G. was my therapist.  She was able to work the knots/tension out of my neck, shoulders, back, calves and hamstrings very well. Her demeanor was polite, attentive and pleasant.  After a 1 hr deep tissue and 20 mins reflexolgy session I felt so much better and not as wound up ball tight.  I plan on returning twice a month per my discussion with my therapist for my level of activity and body type. I'd highly recommend Joey G.\nEverything has been great, from the 1st contact call to my session and after with the receptionist.  Highly recommend Elements and will send my personal friends as well.\nI will continue to use Elements Massage Summerlin and Joey G. as my therapist for the forseeable future.

Last year I went to The Used at Desert Breeze, and a guy who totally should not have been crowd surfing did, and he landed on my head, and I heard a crack in my neck, and then my jaw popped out of alignment and started clicking. NOT fun. \n\nWith 3 trips to Dr. Reiss, all was fixed and I have not had the clicking issue since! He and his staff are extremely professional, likeable, and efficient. With the exception of the first visit (spinal scan), I haven't had a time where it has taken me more than 20 minutes in the office. He is quick, and he gets the job done, and gets you on your way. I love his philosophy of \"we are here when you need us\" as well - they have never been pushy, and I am usually able to get same-day appointments very easily. \n\nA couple months after the jaw issue, I got a wicked knot under my shoulder blade that if not for Dr. Reiss, I wouldn't have been able to walk let alone go back to work the very next day. Any time I roll out of bed wrong or my body is just not having a good day, I go to see him with almost magical results - I couldn't ask for a better chiropractor. \n\nEach time I go into the office, it feels like home or like I am seeing a long-time friend. I am so thankful that I got referred to him. The first visit he gives you a little gift bag, and if you sign up for his mailing list, he sends you other perks as well along the way. At the end of 2012 he even sent out cards to cover your co-pay! (Which I totally needed thanks to my pesky shoulder of DOOM.) \n\nThanks to Dr. Reiss I am living a much less painful existence.

I did, however, notice a slight discomfort in my teeth from the whitening procedure, but it went away overnight.

I was so nervous that I was not going to find anyone to take a new patient let alone an emergency. They sheduled an appointment for her within the hour and we were on our way! I was so impressed by the staff and the overall experience. This was her first trip to the dentist ever and they worked so well with her. She left asking when we would be back! :) Needless to say, Dr. Biehl will now be the dentist for our whole family.", "business_id": "m4si0py7QMsRcWxgkXK96Q", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-11-21", "type": "review"}

On top of that, I am not looking forward to being lectured about how I don't floss enough or exactly how I need to brush.  But, I needed a good dentist in my area so I made an appointment with Chapparal Dental.\n\nFirst of all, his staff is amazing.  I had to reschedule my appointment a couple times and Christy was really flexible and always very nice.  His office is clean, with a good selection of magazines and good music to boot.\n\nAs far as the actual dental experience goes, Dr. Tricolli is the best dentist I have had.  He was pleasant, funny and incredibly knowledgeable.  He actually walked through my X-Rays with me and explained what was going on in my mouth.  His bedside manner is excellent as well.  He had suggestions as far as my oral hygiene went but never forced anything on me and didn't judge me on the fact that flossing is not necessarily an everyday activity for me.

Crappy service, Crappy food and double the pay! I delivered my second child two weeks ago and felt tortured. I had my first delivery two years ago at St. Rose Sienna and had a good experience so I thought that since they are both named St. Rose, they would have the same quality care. As soon as I got wheel chaired in, since I was already in active labor, the nurse had to poke me 3 times and kept popping my vain which resulted in a huge bruise on both arms. Right there and then I knew I made the wrong decision. So everything else went smooth and my awesome OB came who barely got any help from the nurse. She even had to clean up and was doing their job after the delivery. 8 hours later I'm still sitting in a pool of blood because the nurse said that two other person came in to give birth. And when she finally came I was breastfeeding my daughter so I asked her if she can come back and she replied, \"Its either she cleans me up now or she will have to help someone else and won't be back for who knows how many more hours. I told her its ok to help someone else. Then that morning, I was STARVING for food and I remember that St. Rose Sienna always had great food, so I was anticipating to place an order, which they do at Sienna. Instead a man comes in the room drops of two trays and leaves. It was definitely not enough and my husband had to go downstairs to the cafeteria and spend $20 to get more food. So someone came in and I complained about the breakfast. They finally gave me a sheet to order from which I was familiar with from Sienna. I ordered my lunch and dinner. Lunch came and it was ok, and then dinner came and it wasn't what we ordered. So I called the nurse to let them know and the same guy that dropped of the breakfast came in our room with an attitude saying that what we ordered was for the following day???  And that if we wanted what we actually ordered it's going to take hours. Then how come our lunch came out ok. And we placed it the same time? Anyways, I ended up breaking down and crying because I felt like they were so rude. Good thing there was an employee, who actually work in a different department (social secutrity/admin) who went out of her way and went straight to the kitchen to get our food.  After that incident I wanted to run home and get out of there! I made sure I left 24 hours after my delivery and not anytime longer. I ended up leaving the hospital at 9PM because I didn't want to stay overnight. Now that I'm home I just got a bill from San Martin twice as much as I had to pay at Sienna. Keep in mind I stayed at Sienna for almost 4 days and they served us steak and prawns our fist night as new parents and at San Martin I only stayed for 1  1/2 days. On top of that I got another bill stating that their workers are not employees of the hospital?? They are contracted and that there is a separate bill for their care also. UNBELIEVABLE!! I don't usually do reviews but I thought that it would help other expecting mothers to make the right decision. Giving birth is such an experience that its so important to get special care. I wouldn't want anyone else to go through what I went through. San Martin SUCK!", "business_id": "5FTEU6KCvMeZyuqkbLAWtw", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-08-12", "type": "review"}

Most of the time I feel like she's rushed but what drives me nuts is how she talks about organic food everytime I'm there!  When I have gynocological questions, she kinda brushes me off and then steers the conversation back to organic eating.  It drives me crazy, I'm not there to see a dietician....", "business_id": "JVb5BRi7NSgXqVoMJCO0Hw", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-03-13", "type": "review"}

They seem to overbook appointments resulting in a very rushed experience. Often, the dentist will be working on two or more patients simultaneously, shuttling between rooms while waiting for anesthesia to take effect or for a hygienist to finish up. Some of the most highly-efficient dentistry I've ever encountered. Henry Ford would be proud.\n\nAnd your dentist is likely to be a foreigner fresh out of dental school.

I explained, at one point my fever was so high, I was hallucinating... and allergies have never done that before, but he shrugged it off and insisted it was allergies. \n\nI asked him for a flu test, because I was SURE this wasn't allergies. He did it. It was negative. So I believe him. I went home, took some Alergra D and went to bed. \n\nThe next day,  I was far worse, the \"head congestion\" was now deep in my chest, and I was worse than I was the day before. I ended up in the ER with walking pneumonia. The Doctor was beyond shocked that the PA recommended a decongestant, which forced the infection to STAY in my lungs, rather than be coughed up. \n\nThanks for nearly killing me FastMed, and charging me 175 dollars to boot.", "business_id": "Rwci2Nk8g92BMOsEIayNuA", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-11-08", "type": "review"}

(Granted I have school, she took off more time for work, and my dad's going without food again)\n\n3 doctor rolls on in, states some genius had a hole in their glove and contaminated all the work equipment which would take an hour to fix. 4 pm rolls around. 5 pm rolls around. 6 pm rolls around. We ask every hour what in hell is going on, still receive no information - at 6, we finally learn that an emergency case came in and they used the room which they had prepped for my dad, and said it would be another 20 minutes.\n6:30 rolls around. they come in tell us another 20 minutes.\n7:15 rolls around. my dad is raging, and we're trying to calm him down but he hasn't eaten all day and is in a lot of pain - I don't blame him for being pissed at this horrendous system they call a hospital.\n7:30 rolls around and they finally get him in, but I forgot to mention the nurses who all gathered his information all went home (boy lucky them) so we got some potato head genius's who roll in asking all the same questions, which just makes this situation feel even more smooth.\nAll in all, this is the biggest joke of a hospital experience I've witnessed.\nIf I was there for the first day, I would have had him transferred to another hospital.\nSurprised my mother didn't. If I was there the first day, I would have probably exploded at the staff about how incompetent they were.\n\nwould not recommend anyone with a sick or injured family member to come here. we came here because it was closer, but next time will definitely tell ambulance or whoever to take the injured person out of their way to banner baywood or banner desert.\n\nPROS:\n- friendly nurse staff\n-clean environment\n-good hospital food\n\nCONS:\n-terrible communcation skills (Between staff and staff-to-patient)\n-horrible bedside manner in shift transition (potato heads waltz in asking redudant questions with a cheeky smile on their face when we've waitied for days and are irate beyond belief. how about some communication if you don't feel like getting yelled at).\n-awful time management and design scheme, how about we make patients wait for days when they have conditions that could put their life in danger if they don't eat.\n\nI would give this place a 0 for their service, and a negative score for trying to hide my review.

I should have waited for the doctor who I was referred to in the ER to have an opening but I was in a ton of pain and wanted to have the surgery as soon as possible. It was no surprise that my liver was inflamed and that Dr. Teng said it was the worst gall bladder case he has ever seen, but at least he got it out and although I now have an 8 inch scar it was worth it to no longer be in the kind of pain I was experiencing.\n\nI too had to pay a deposit before the surgery which I did and then six months after the surgery I received a sizable bill. I couldn't understand why after the deposit and my insurance company pitching in he was still expecting me to pay almost $800! With the ER bills leading up to the surgery taxing our finances as well you can imagine I was not thrilled. My husband tried calling the office at least three times to get the scoop on the bill. When it came in the mail it looked sketchy with no actual descriptive information on it. I could have designed a more legitimate looking invoice on my own computer! We wanted to know what we were paying for exactly and why the balance was so much.

By the time I was done answering questions and typing, the staff had a detailed record and knowledge about my personal dental pain in the db.\n\nData entry was step one in this modern, digitally based specialty practice.  Susie showed me my chair of the morning and the flat panel where my very low level radation X-ray would show up.  Susie stated Dr. Allen works to be on top of the latest techniques and technologies; taking classes, reading journals and applying herself to the things doctors do to keep up with their fields of expertise.  Dr. Allen also hires very smart, attentive staff.  For those down in the mouth, Susie brought her sense of humor.  It's all about endorphins.  You know what they say, \"Endorpheens before morpheens....\"\n\nWe had a few good laughs and lightened the morning.  Susie took my picture for the digital files because the Dr. remembers teeth, not faces.  They agreed the only people appreciating the tech are techies.  I guess that makes me a techie.  \n\nSeeing a specialist was the best thing I could have done.  Dr. Allen looked at my images, pulled her giant ceiling-mount microscope with digital camera, over to focus on my teeth.  She carefully checked my troubled ones with pressure and cold, explained the imagery before us on the screen, then ordered a 3D scan to triple-check her conclusions.  \n\nIt was a spinning monster X-Ray.  360 degree circle, 30 seconds.  In a Hollywood fantasy, it would remove all thought, replacing it with an endless HuLu ad.  Instead, it grabbed a super high-resolution tooth-pic the Dr., Susie and I sliced visually frame by frame; root, old root canal, possible infection, all the bad stuff.  Final conclusion: 90% likelihood of a cracked root.   \n\nThose ladies are REALLY into teeth.  Dr. Allen went to the lab, finding  her \"Boneyard of Teeth\" while Susie told me how much she loved supporting root canal digging and minor oral surgery.  She likes the the blood too.  Eewwww.  Dr. Allen brought out the little plastic box of extracted teeth, finding three examples of what I probably had going.  She was laser-focused on the pecularities of each tooth, delighting in their faults and weak points.  Susie peered on too.  We had a lot of fun. \n\nUntil Savannah came in with a cost estimate between Dr. Vogel's tooth extraction costs and my soon-to-be oral surgery.  I picked Door #3, Susie poked a cotton swab with lydocaine into my right cheek pouch.  Dr. Allen followed swiftly with copious amounts of novacaine, rubber cheek and lips following for me.  I was left awhile to numb up.\n\nThey'd sat me straight up for the numbing part.  I suddenly wanted to relax,  lay back, do yoga breathing and maybe get a quick snoozer in.  I reached down for a reclining lever, hit a small button and the chair of the morning massage feature kicked in.  I slumped lower and lower to get that bad spot right there.  When the Doctor and Susie returned, a series of bad \"Magic Fingers\" quips followed.  Mostly mine.  The quarter will be on my bill.  I always pay for my bad jokes, one way or another.  \n\nThen Dr. Allen came in, pulled out my tooth, showed me the crack, inner infection, infected... never mind, I won't even talk about the bone scraping part.  I'll tell you that I asked a question about a magazine article, they spoke of, I heard a lot about dental community service, from Phoenix to Oklahoma City and beyond.  Awards are on the wall.  \n\nMy new jaw crater was was plugged with a little bone insert and sewn up, Dr. Allen and Susie going on and on about the excellence of the new insert product and stretchy suture thread.  My prescriptions got scripted and I was sent home with orders to return in two weeks.  \n\nIt was my best ever at any dental office.  Don't go unless you must.", "business_id": "6DeyB17j2qwLnyrvggBV2A", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-04-26", "type": "review"}

Do NOT go to see Dr. Erica N. Bigos  (formerly, Erica N. Elannan). I have never had any issues with my teeth. I had a cavity that I got in my 20's. The filing was getting old and I had it redone. About 6 months later I changed dentists to Dr. E bc she is a cosmetic dentist and I was interested in pursuing veneers for my two front teeth, which are mainly composite (from a gap that never closed with braces and from several chips).  After her first visit with me she told me the tooth I just had the filing redone on needed to be crowned because there was a lot of decay. She appeared to be very knowledgeable and I went ahead with her proposed treatment plan.  She's very personable and makes you feel great, like she's the best in the business, don't bother driving to Scottsdale she says, bc she can give you best treatment in Anthem, same lab, cheaper price, and her work is perfection.. so she says. Getting the crown was painful, it did not go without a hitch, and after this experience I would not get veneers in her office. I referred my husband to her for a cleaning bc new patients got free teeth whitening. My husband went and got his teeth cleaned and walked away with a laundry list of items he needed to get done, including more crowns. After getting a second opinion, he did not need the work she recommended, he did not trust her integrity and never went back. After another routine cleaning there, she said I needed another crown on a tooth where I had a filing. Apparently her x-ray showed decay and in her ledger notes she wrote I needed to get it \"taken care of ASAP or risk a root canal\". This concerned me, bc my typical appointments with dentist run very smoothly, aside from the 2-3 cavities I had in my early years. After a second opinion, I was told that was absolutely ridiculous. Then her staff followed up consistently to get it scheduled... so you can make sure you \"use up all of your insurance by the end of year bc it doesn't roll over.\" I got a crown on a tooth that I likely didn't even need. I have had two dentists since, both have confirmed I did not need that second crown she recommended. Three years later, the second tooth she recommended I get crowned hasn't been touched and it's 100% fine, yet I know have major issues with her crown work, as a result I may need an extraction! SEVERAL other residents in Anthem have had similar complaints and lawsuits!........ I will say this, they are aware that I am not happy with my experience there and while I will never step foot in their office again, they offered to rectify the situation.

I left there feeling like a million bucks like the weight of being arrested for trying to feel normal with no pain. \nThe bad \nThe office while it seemed very professional there were a few things that jumped out to me I did hear them yelling at one another and also they seemed to have had a friend visiting while that is ok I would not want a stranger looking at my medical files. \nOverall\nThis place is great they will calm your fears and help you get what you need I would recommend to anyone.

My doctor there was always friendly, respectful, efficient, and very helpful.  This is a well run office and I never waited more than five or ten minutes in the waiting room, and never more then ten in the exam room.  If they were a bit late, they apologized.  I had several health issues while I was under their care, and my doctor referred me on to other excellent doctors in the orthopedic, gastroenterology, surgical and allergy fields.  I received very good care from the specialists I needed.  I always felt that I had plenty of access to my doctor through their patient portal system, and received timely answers to questions.  My doctor there was very interested in helping me  have a good understanding of any of my issues, with special attention to discussing treatment options.  I never felt that I was talked down to or patronized.  Frankly, I truly hated to give them up but a move four states away forced me to seek other care, but my doctor has still been available to me answer questions and even to continue my care and prescriptions until I get settled. I highly recommend this group.  I know one person wrote that his appointment was canceled because he was 7 minutes late, but they do advise you in their literature that if  you are late, your appointment might be rescheduled.  They strive to be very punctual, and a late patient throws the whole schedule off. This happened to my husband, but he was ten minutes late, and they were already on to the next patients. He understood and they just rescheduled him.  They were not uncaring or discourteous about it, but just professional.

I was celebrating the coming New Year with friends in our favorite bar in Detroit, Michigan, when I finished a mouthful of shrimp and told my BFF Ricky 'I don't feel well.' My next memory was being surrounded by a bunch of over-animated queens who could barely conceal their snarky attitudes because I was the shit and I ruled that part of town. I spent the rest of the evening in Ricky's car turning the engine on to melt the frost on the windows. Well, after we made it back to Ohio the next day, Ricky told my parents what happened and they made me go to the doctor. Something about thinking my epilepsy had returned. However, after several tests and a few thousand dollars out of pocket, they couldn't tell me what had happened and concluded it was just a fainting spell. \n\nSo, clearly, I was hesitant about going to a doctor once I moved out to Arizona and hadn't made any appointments with a doctor for about 8 years. Sadly, I developed a painful ear ache and was left with no choice, after almost 2 months of self-medicating, but to schedule an appointment with a doctor. Since I'm generally lazy and look for the easiest way out of something, I found the addresses of fie general practitioners covered by my insurance in our ZIP code, mapped out which was accessible by light rail, by light rail and one bus transfer and by walking distance during a pleasant month in Phoenix. That's how I decided to go to Dr. McRunels. \n\nI was feeling a little uneasy about seeing a stranger and having to go through my medical history (back home, we went to the same doctor who delivered us so he was kind of along for the journey of our lives). But the staff and Dr. McRunels dissipated any concerns by being professional yet friendly. This wasn't what I was expecting. Even though I had gone for my ear ache, they were willing to discuss any other medical concerns I may have, whether my body was functioning any differently in the past few years, if I developed any new moles, and other conditions that may have presented themselves in the years since I last had a thorough exam. \n\nNot surprisingly, I survived the appointment and was able to fill my prescription at Target in 20 minutes. \n\nNow I can call my mom and let her know I now have my own doctor!", "business_id": "1hgsmrezZ4IUMcdlYDEeOw", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-06-30", "type": "review"}

Along with everyone always being kind and just cool to the patient throughout the whole long process (let's face it, starving and dehydrating for hours before those can make us a little loopy, so extra niceness is always appreciated).\n\nAnd the scans themselves are top-notch as far as i can tell and from what my specialists say, catching every little thing as well as the big stuff, [as compared to some shady place i went recently (Arcadia Radiology) where the results had a specialist looking askance and saying, \"um, is this even a real radiology place??

My Fiance & I had received a couple of Gift Cards for our recent engagement and decided we could use a Massage. I went on SpaFinders website to finder a merchant who accept their SpaFinder Gift Cards and I stumbled across SpaMassage For You. I checked out the Yelp reviews prior to visiting the business and the majority of bad reviews were placed by disgruntled Groupon users. First off, I don't think the majority of Groupon users are Cheap like some of these other reviews state. I think that without clear and concise Fine Print things are easily confused. My issue comes from the fact that prior to going to this business, I looked ALL OVER for any fine print, restrictions, exclusions, or anything at all regarding the usage of my SpaFinder Gift Cards. When I say ALL OVER, I mean I look on the merchants website, I looked on the merchants SpaFinder page, I looked on SpaFinders Website, and I also looked on the Gift Cards themselves... There was ZERO restrictions stated anywhere. Needless to say at the time of payment I handed over my Gift Cards and I was promptly told that the Gift Cards weren't accepted on the weekends and that I would have to come back another day to use them. I was also told that I should have said something when I was scheduling the appointment. I gladly obliged to pay and still tipped the Therapists over 20% on the service, this was because I actually thought I might have missed something somewhere, somehow. The reason for this review is because I went back and looked everywhere, AGAIN, and still couldn't find anything. So I called SpaFinder's Customer Service and asked if there were any restrictions or stipulations to how their Gift Cards are used. The Representative quickly and easily told me no, there are NO restrictions on the usage of their Gift Cards. At that point it was very easy to tell that there was some sort of share on the value of the Gift Cards between SpaFinder and the merchant, which is evident in why they didn't want to accept the Gift Cards. I am by no means a \"cheap\" person and I FIRMLY believe that you pay for what you get.. But if I have a Gift Card given to be as a gift, why wouldn't I attempt to use it? It's unfortunate because I was looking for a Spa to become a frequent customer at because I realized the importance of getting massages done regularly. I would've considered calling this Spa 'home' had it not been for this experience. There's no excuse for not accepting the Gift Cards and if they honestly don't accept the Gift Cards on weekends (even though SpaFinder clearly said they cannot make up their own rules on accepting their Gift Cards) then they should be the ones to have that clearly stated somewhere, ANYWHERE. ~~~ ON A GOOD NOTE ~~~ The Therapists were very talented, nice, and seemed to truly care about what you were looking to get out of the service. They were all pretty friendly and although they were remodeling, I'm sure it will be a beautiful place upon it's completion. Just make sure to spell out anything and everything you intend on doing or using at the business as they do not do it for you.\n\nUPDATE:\nMerchants responding to Yelp reviews is crucial, so I appreciate the quick response. However, I still do not feel as if the response is justified in regards to my issue. First off, there was never any communication regarding the price I was receiving being Discounted, especially since there isn't anywhere for me to see pricing for Services. Secondly, the excuse given to me by you after my appointment was that you do not accept the gift cards on the weekends. Nothing was ever mentioned about it being due to a discounted rate. Lastly, if given the option, I would've preferred to be charged the normal price of $79 because it actually would have ended up being a less amount for me out of pocket. Whether it be $49 or $79, they are both still very fair priced amounts, so this is not the issue. The issue is the lack of communication as well as the fact that even if the services were discounted by you, SpaFinder specifically & clearly explained that merchants on their website that list they accept SpaFinder Gift Cards have no control over dictating how those Gift Cards are used. To avoid future complaints or issues similar to mine, maybe you should consider asking potential customers if they plan on using any coupons, or gift cards for the service.\n\nUPDATE 8/17: This merchant has repeatedly lied to cover their tracks. They told SpaFinder that not only did we not present the Gift Cards at the time of the appointment, but they stayed open later for us and made special arrangements. You guys are cheapskates and worse than the \"cheap\" groupon people you say come to your business and screw you guys. Well good for them, liars tend to get what they deserve. Unfortunately for you, you're not smart liars and I have taken screenshots of your responses in regards to you REFUSING to accept the Gift Cards.", "business_id": "8e8TiiCzN3wfbedO6KTzhw", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-07-29", "type": "review"}

I normally go to Palestra Skin and Body institue on Casewell near the hospital but I wanted to try another place that may have more facial options. I made a appointment here. The staff was very friendly and the place it self was very clean and well put together. It was my first time some one came and took me on a small tour and then I shorlty met Cassie the girl that was doing my facial. This place had ALL good reviews on Yelp and city search so I really wanted to give them a try. The service I wanted cost around 800$ which was how much it cost everywhere but the facial i got called the Hydro facial cost me 150$. I was expecting something really good since my normal facial place Palestra is like 60 dollars for my express facial, which includes, steaming, extractions, antibacterial currents, mask and moisturizer, so I was really thinking i was going to get my 150 worth at AR. The Md came in and talked to me and he was rather nice. The facial itself felt AMAZING but I really dont think it was work 150, I later saw on there price menu all the facials are around 125 and up. I dont mind paying for something if I am getting something extra but Palestra was just better. The room I was in was very little at not as comfortable as I am used to. This could be b\\c this is considerered a medical spa, but i just wanted to give a honest review b\\c I did not see any reviews like this about price etc when I went. .I prefer the comforting spa like atmosphere so I will prob stick with Palestra", "business_id": "NuR9H7UNdldK3x3EV08-wQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-10-24", "type": "review"}

When I explained I've been wearing mac for years many would probably think she would tell me to stop wearing that because it is heavier. However since we've found it doesn't irritate my skin it's A OK with her. It's those type of personalized conversations she has with you on each visit that help the process to go faster. She also sells skin care products that work so well. The facial cleanser (milk one) is amazing and I try and use my \"Jennifer in a bottle\" acid almost every night. \n\nI am 27 and serious about preventing aging and I think going to Jennifer is a great way to keep that goal on track. She's also very sweet and wonderful to talk to. I leave Jennifer with better skin and a better peace of mind with whatever is going on in my life. She doesn't charge for that service but she probably should. :)\n\nI usually get the mix of a facial, extraction, dermaplane then microderm and top it all off with a cherry.. no actually you get a chemical peel at the end. About 5 days later you'll have lost the top layer of skin and you will look absolutely fabulous darling. You look great the next day too but after you peel is when you really see it. It's a hard hitting combo that works. \n\nShe's also a great person to talk to about filler and botox although she doesn't do that herself.

I've spent my fair share of time visiting you over the last two years. Figuring out hip injuries is anything but easy. I have seen several different people here and I can't speak highly enough for them. \n\nDr Stone, Sports Medicine. He knows his shit! He even had a resident with him, so I had the pleasure of learning more about my injury while he taught her. I visited for a sports hernia/labral tear. Dr Stone was very straight with me on what was going on. He knew the injury better than anyone I saw over the course of two years. He also knew what doctors could help, in and out of network. He gave me options for what route I go with recovery, made himself available via phone to check in on the results of actions, and was careful to explain everything, asking if I understood partially through feeding me information. If you have a sports injury, he's your guy! \n\nDr Wright, orthopedic surgery. This lady is all business. You have seen many doctors, no need to beat around the bush. She is not the one to go to if you are only set on surgery. Dr Wright is not quick to cut, something rare and very respectable in a surgeon. She did a hip scope on me and informed me that she takes 1/10 people she sees about hip injuries to the OR. Before doing surgery on me I went to several different types of therapy to try to fix the problem conservatively. This is the type of surgeon you want to see. She does a lot of research outside of the OR on the hip, and I would say is on her way to figuring out what all happens in the hip, an area of the body that is well behind the knee as far as medical knowledge goes. She even lengthened the hip flexor, something my PT later told me is really good for hip surgeries, as when they aren't lengthened they can cause many problems. Her explanation to my family on the surgery was very detailed and informative. I am not sure how she has time to accomplish all of the things she does, but I am impressed. \n\nKeelan Enseki, PT. Something you learn after having surgery is you spend most of your recovery with your therapist. Keelan is extremely knowledgeable, especially with hips. I can't be thankful enough for being referred to him. Outside of therapy he attends conferences to continue education and also is a professor for students becoming physical therapists. Keelan directs your recovery to your lifestyle and the things you want to accomplish once you have recovered. He listens to what things are bothersome during recovery and suggests things to do at home to help fix the issues. A must see PT for people with hip injuries! \n\nI am so impressed with the knowledge and talent UPMC Sports Med is full of. For all injuries sports related, this is your place.\n\nNOTE: If you are seeing a doctor, get an appointment in the early am. All doctors tend to be behind schedule in the afternoon.", "business_id": "M81DfL9-BLugRVnasW2Dgg", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-01-24", "type": "review"}

I had an evening appointment and the front office was closed when I got there, so I started filling out my new patient paperwork just as a sign had instructed. There was a bell to ring for service but no one came when I rang it (three times over 40 minutes). As people (I assume they were other therapists) came out of offices, no one acknowledged me or returned my smile. I finally got someone to take my paperwork and continued to wait. \n\nI got into my appointment about 15 minutes late. That happens and I don't fault anyone for that, but my appointment was also cut short. My therapist was disinterested in the entire shortened session. I was dressed pretty nicely but had exposed tattoos that seemed to bother her. She stared and seemed distracted, making me feel the need to explain to her that I was a good person more than once. Mind you, I was there for self esteem and anxiety issues, so feeling judged by an apathetic therapist was pretty unsettling. She didn't smile, she wasn't warm, and she wasn't encouraging.\n\nAfter I left, I jokingly told someone that the therapy session helped in its own way because the woman I saw was so curt and unpleasant that it made me feel like a better person.", "business_id": "_4VapLIt_vHJ0iL_qnMzeQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-06-03", "type": "review"}

I really appreciated this because that's what professional doctors are supposed to do. Usually if you're sick or stressed out it's been my experience they want to throw medication at you, or do a 5 minute sweep of your body, tell you you're fine, and please leave. I utilized the advice he gave me for my neck on proper stretches, and then for stress management to get back in the gym and start exercising more. I haven't had anymore headaches since the day he adjusted me and I have had thriving results with the stress management and getting back in the gym, the 2nd visit was just to go back and check in again, make sure my neck was still in good shape and that was that!

The staff is SO friendly, even more so than any other Y I have been to. Each time I walk in the door or exit, I turn down my music on my iPod to say Hello or Goodbye to the staff at the front desk because they always make an effort to speak to me. And I truly appreciate that. I have also spoken to a couple of the trainers several times, including Victor, who is always very smiley and helpful if I need it. Bonus: If I am not in a conversational mood, the staff just smiles instead of bothering me while I am trying to get my workout on. I'm sure some of you have experienced the flirty male trainers who want to stop you mid workout to chat.. Ugh.\n\nThis location is a little smaller than the main Y's but it has plenty of room to move around as all of the machines and cardio equipment are located on the main level. The lower level houses the fitness classrooms so if you never take one, then you will never see them. No people to watch you while you look like an idiot doing Zumba or yoga stretches. ;)\n\nThe locker rooms are clean and organized and also offer a sauna and steam room!\n\nThe member base of this gym is sometimes sort of blah.

She even promised, \"You have your baby tomorrow morning.\" \n\nIt was a nice massage, and though I only paid for 45 minutes, she worked for over an hour, always making sure I was comfy and happy.\n\nHere's the thing: My water broke an hour afterwards, and I had my baby at 7:01am.

I avoid it and hope it won't be necessary. It works until, oops!  I needed periodontal work and after meeting Dr. De Andrade at a meeting, I asked him if he would take a look at me. (This was a Thursday night, I told him a quick overview of what I thought I needed and he arranged to see me the next Tuesday.)\n \nIt all started before I even got there. Nathan (Office Coordinator) emailed me the forms.  Saved time.\n \nWhen I walked in the door of the Office, things start to get even easier.  Nathan is a whirlwind of organization and precision (these words will appear often in describing this Office).  He is friendly, approachable and will put his full attention on you.  He checks to see how you are and learn what you need.  He doesn't waste your time and he is as patient as you need him to be. \n \nThe atmosphere in the whole office is like this.  The waiting area is comfortable and you can see Carolyn or Dolores focused on screens and keyboards - busily making things happen, but available for a question. Everyone in this Office knows about helping people feel \"welcome and comfortable\".  (I love that about this place.)\n \nFrom the moment I decided to talk with Dr. De Andrade, things got easier. This is a guy who \"Listens\".  He wants to know what is important to me about my teeth and what's going on. He is personable without being over-solicitous or phony.  He genuinely cares and believes that he is in the business of \"Care-Giving\".  He lives it and it's obvious. That, by itself is amazing.  This is a guy you can count on and he won't BS you and he won't take advantage of you.  (To me, these are things that are harder and harder to find these days.)\n \nHe has Dental Assistants both seasoned and new.  Barbara has a delightfully energetic presence and worked to immediately make me comfortable in the chair. She has been there for a while and knows the Doc well.  (The dental chair has a massager for the back! - Every little bit helps.)  Katherine is competent, attentive and gently reassuring.  Both Assistants move with practiced ease and don't hesitate to ask questions.\n  \n I'm not talking about a Spa - I am talking about an exceptional Periodontal Office.  Yes!  A Dentist!  It is called Anthem Periodontics and Dental Implants. They are in the Henderson and Las Vegas areas - write me and I will pass along their contact info bobsmith@mysuccess.com if you have any trouble finding it.\n \nI had a tooth with a hole in it (under the gum, eeeee-UUU) and it was getting painful.  I had put it off as long as I thought I could get away with it.  I also found that I had a failed Root Canal.\n \nI met with the Doc and we agreed that the teeth involved were best turn into implants. \n \nI told the Doc about being a \"chicken\" about the dental chair and when he started to numb me, he said that he had the \"Chicken\" numbing protocol.  (It made me laugh out loud with relief.) He gave me the \"local\" in little steps so I didn't have to climb the walls from getting stuck.  He kept me informed the whole way and he checked on my comfort throughout the process.  No pain, no discomfort. (Yes, I was stressed - but it was out of habit.)\n \nHe removed both teeth and they had different degrees of challenge.  He was exceptional.  He made me comfortable the whole time and was attentive to detail as well as my experience.\n \nHe told me what was going on, let me know what he needed from me (tilt my head or lean my face one way or another).  He was patient, precise, efficient and comforting - all at the same time!  Listening to him made me think this could all work out beyond just good enough.\n \nHe called me the next evening and checked on me.  He asked about very specific things I was doing or feeling and reviewed what was coming up next.  He reminded me that we would connect in two weeks, answered some questions I had about eating and we are off to the races.  \n \nI did follow instructions.  I iced my face the way he and Barbara said - viola, no swelling today.\n \nPost procedure pain was very easy to manage with Ibuprofen.\n\nThe details are the important part.  This guy and his staff are delightful.  They don't take their patients or their jobs for granted and they make it easy to do what is necessary to get my mouth back on track.\n \nThis man knows what he is doing, he won't steer you wrong, he won't make you feel wrong or stupid (too many Dentist's wag their fingers with \"shoulds\").  Dr. De Andrade is someone you can count on.  I would trust this Doctor with my Wife, Son or Daughter. And I am actually comfortable thinking about my next appointment with him.\n \nThanks\n \nBob", "business_id": "Uea3DOBa6Ry3UyT7-5oblA", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-03-31", "type": "review"}

I couldn't take full breaths.  I had to hunch a little because sitting up or walking straight hurt.  My initial thought was that since I practice yoga, I can heal myself.  I tried downward dog, plow pose, donurasana, spinal twists.  I tried hanging upside down and everything.   \n\nWe've all heard stories about chiropractic.  It seems people either love them or hate them.  This was my first visit to a chiropractor, and I am a fan.         \n\nAlthough this guy, Danny is new to the Phoenix valley, he has been practicing in another state for a while.  He seems like he is from the mid west.  He is calm and and exudes a casual friendliness.     \n\nThe office was slow or he was ready for me.  He led me to a table right away.  He took a minute to feel around as we talked about my pain.  He said it was obviously T7 based on what I was feeling in my back and it was quite common.  He said could skip the X-ray, if I wanted, since I mentioned I was price sensitive.    \n\nIt didn't take long.  He adjusted me and then gave a brief massage around the area stretching the muscles around it.  He said it was important to adjust the muscles around the problem area because muscles are what holds the bones in place.  The massage was great.  Danny seems to have a massage background.  \n\nWhen I stood up, the pain was already gone.  As I write this review it has been 4 days and the pain has stayed away.  I did 30 miles on my bike today.

What surprises me most is that this Danny at Clarity solved my problem in probably less than 15 minutes and I don't need to go back.   \n\nI am used to doctors wanting to follow up perpetually for anther $50 visit etc....this guy seems to know he cured me and that was his intention.

What the heck are ya gonna do about it, right?\n\nWell, I'll tell you what I did about it - I went to Sona Med Spa in Ballantyne to inquire about a number of treatments.\n\nI'm not usually a vain person, but something just clicked when I hit the big 4-0. There are things that I don't like about my body, and dammit I have the means to do something about them, so why don't I? There's no reason to live with something you don't like if you don't have to.\n\nI visited Sona Med Spa and talked with Cassidy, who gave me pricing on laser hair removal (bikini and underarms) and laser treatments for the rosacea on my face. My leg hair was really too light for laser hair removal, so that was out, but I was sick of shaving the rest. \n\nFor laser hair removal, I had previously visited \"Ideal Image\" for a quote as well. The woman was nice, but she tried to sell me on leg laser hair removal, even though my hair was clearly too light. Sona had MUCH better pricing on the laser hair removal, and I could get the AFT package for my rosacea at a great discount. Both combined were cheaper than the quote I got for just the hair removal at Ideal Image, so I jumped at the offer from Sona.\n\nI figured I'd wait until I was through with most of the package purchases before writing a review. So here I am, after 4 AFT and 4 laser treatments. The AFT has worked great. I had so many broken capillaries and veins on my face that I needed foundation just to look decent. After 4 rounds of AFT, I can't find a broken vein around my nose. My face looks more clear and calm and I don't have nearly as many flushing issues as I used to have.\n\nThe laser hair removal has been a mixed bag. I'm about 50% done with hair removal by my observation, but I only have a couple of sessions left. I will probably need additional sessions for full hair removal. Still, after session 3, I really started to notice a decrease in hair on my bikini line and underarms.  There is still a way to go.\n\nTo be clear: both procedures hurt. Some of them hurt like \"HECK\"! AFT is worse than the laser hair removal for me. (If your hair is dark and coarse, laser hair removal will hurt worse, but mine is medium coarseness, at best.) Sona will provide you with an Rx for a topical anesthetic ointment if you want. After 2 AFT sessions I opted to purchase the ointment. For my 3rd AFT session, I showed up with a face \"numbed\" by the ointment and having popped 4 Ibuprofen preemptively for pain. It was still awful. So awful that I decided to forego the ointment and Ibuprofen for my last session. If you're doing AFT, you kind of just have to suck it up and realize that beauty and even skin tone HURTS. Half of it's psychological. The other half is terrifyingly physical. :-) But if you get Roe, just chat with her and she'll help take your mind off things.\n\nSuffice to say, I celebrated my last session of AFT even though it meant no more sessions with my buddy Roe. \n\nI have to dock Sona Med Spa in Ballantyne a star because sometimes their scheduling is awful. I have waited for 65+ minutes for a 15 minute treatment before. They have lost two of my appointments. Their scheduling is terrible. Now, I get them to write my scheduling down on cards, and I save them like they're lifelines. I once received a call to confirm an appointment, and when I called back to say I could make it, they had LOST the appointment in their system.\n\nThe people at Sona Med Spa Ballantyne are great, but their scheduling system is hideous. Be careful about scheduling and be prepared to wait an hour for your service. If they can see you in 5 minutes after you arrive, it's a bonus!\n\nThat said, I arrived 45 minutes early for an appointment one time, because I had put it in my Outlook calendar for 11 (instead of 11:45 - seriously, save those cards!). When I showed up uber-early, the receptionist took the time to help me schedule all my next appointments AND answered all of my questions about Botox during the time I was waiting. So, as I said, they're good people. Just get firm on your appointment times.\n\nI do like Sona a great deal. Watch your appointment times like a hawk, show up and watch your age issues melt away.", "business_id": "kaJxcwF4XPi7x2cdHdRcqA", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-05-04", "type": "review"}

Let me start by saying Dr. Todd Gardner was the best chiropractor I have ever been to. After my car accident I saw a chiropractor for almost a year and never got the results I got with Dr. Gardner on my first visit. Apparently its all down hill from there. Todd was let go for reasons unknown recently. On to the more serrious issue.  I called towards the beginning of July to ask for my wife and I to go to a per visit payment ( we currently have the family plan with 4 visits each per month) due to my lack of time to go stop by. Last month I didnt go a single time. I was told it would be a problem by one of the receptionists and that effective immediately I would no longer be getting charged. On the 29th, I was charged anyway. I went by there and the office manager told me she would contact her main office and get it \"taken care of\" I called again today to follow up and was told by yet another young lady ( 3 different people on 3 different calls) that I would not be receiving a refund and that was the end of it. I explained to her the entire situation and she told me that the first lady did not have the authority to make that decision so it didnt matter what she said. As I was attempting to plead my case, she literally hung up on me in the middle of my sentence. Now, regardless of everything else, this is complately unacceptable. I will no longer be visiting the Joint at ANY location nationwide as I would rather pay more where I am appreciated. I have sent a letter to their customer service department or whoever receives them and if in fact they do the right thing, I will gladly correct my review. But as of right now, I cannot in any stretch of good faith, recommend this place to anyone who values customer service.\n\nUpdate:\nI was contacted By Mark who is the regional manager. As soon as I had the opportunity to explain the situation to him, not only did he fix the problem, but he went above and beyond to do so. As someone who works in the customer service business, I must say that I am beyond pleased with how the situation was resolved. I will be back and will now continue to be a customer of the Joint and will definately continue to recommend this place to any of my friends or customers in need.

Basically they cut away skin and muscle from my temporal and occipital bones, drilled a hole in my skull and placed padding between the fifth cranial nerve and some 'offending' artery.  The surgeon did what appears at this time to be a great job.  My scar is very small compared to patients of other neurosurgeons, so my review here, is an attempt at an accurate account of my hospital stay and experience.  \n\nThe waiting room and time were fine for my experience, but the negative aspects would be the lack of pain management, uncomfortable recovery, and the bossy nurses.  Currently, one week after my surgery I am managing my pain with Tylenol and whisky.  I ran out of oxycodone today and apparently they do not refill it after 4:30pm.  \n\nIt must be standard operating procedure in the hospital business to supply the patient/customer with no more than one week of pain medication after surgery, which has been the case here.  In my opinion, it is immoral.  There are 1,000s of people out there in pain that cannot get relief.  After dozens of unrelated surgeries, I anticipate it, personally, but potential patients/customers here should be forewarned of UPMC's incompetent system.  My suggestion is whisky or vodka; although nausea inducing, and disorienting, with the proper moderation they allow for some relief and sleep.  We patients/customers, get treated like inmates or something.  It's degrading.  \n\nAt any rate, prior to my surgery, I first found myself discussing Egyptian archaeology with a  pre-operative nurse whom did not believe in the efficacy of Carbon-14 dating and presumably evolution.  In my experience as a patient, creationism is an extremely common position in the medical profession, but I always find it disturbing that people exerting control over my body's biochemistry disbelieve in basic biology.  I suppose on the other hand, appreciation of genetics and paleontology have relatively little bearing on the competence of those wheeling carts around, filling out forms and discarding human waste.    Nonetheless, here are a couple of links outlining our present understanding of Geologic Time, etc. for any potential nurse reading this.   \n\nhttp://paleobiology.si.edu/geotime/main/\nhttp://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2010/3059/pdf/FS10-3059.pdf\nhttp://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/geotime/radiometric.html\n\nIn the Operating Room, they didn't talk to me very much even though I was asking questions and put in the really painful burning anesthetic into my left arm's I.V. line.  \nUpon awakening, I remember a lot of pain, disorientation and vomiting.  It was extremely uncomfortable.  Usually, one awakens with pain and thirst, but here I remember them asking all kinds of questions while my head hurt and I was vomiting.  They also had in a urethral catheter, which was very uncomfortable.  I was able to get them to take it out only after begging for a long time.  One thing I hate in a hospital stay, is a urethral catheter.  I didn't need one, and resent the fact I woke up with one in.   I also woke up with an extra I.V. line in my inner elbow area.  I always request that my I.V.s be placed away from joints as they bruise the veins when I move, but obviously, this request was ignored in the O.R.  It would take them over 24 hours to remove it.  \n\nThe hospital room was nice and the nurses a bit bossy, which I guess was protocol for a neurosurgery patient.  They kept making me look around, tell the date and push my feet and hands into the air.  All I wanted to do was sleep.  At any rate it took them a long time to inject me with pain medication and remove extra I.V. input lines.  I was nauseous and could only eat Jello, which they readily supplied effectively.  \n\nSo, now I'm still sore and at home, but doing a lot better.  Seemed like an effective hospital and the associated school has a great reputation- one of the best in the world, in fact.  I've heard that the other hospitals in Pittsburgh have better food and rooms however.", "business_id": "p4R_85lf1om4ndYJLVgc_g", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-09-03", "type": "review"}

First of all I love the idea of hot yoga, and I did practice before at Bikrams Yoga too but as I got older, and for someone like me who has various different physical illnesses, Moksha became very valuable to me.\n\nI tried it as a suggestion from a friend of mine, who is now trained in Hatha Yoga.  I asked her for some differences, and she said that it would be something I had to try, but she found it more spiritual. I wasn't entirely sure what she meant by that but now that I have been practicing there for over a year, I have a better understanding. \n\nThe teachers there are great. I got an introductory package for $20 and I was able to experience as many classes as I wanted to. There were different types of Yoga instructed in there. Moksha, Flow, Yin Yoga are the ones I stick with. Due to restrictions in my body (joints, bones etc.) it is not possible for me to perform all the moves, at first I was a bit shy to ask, but then I decided I wanted the most of my practice. The teachers there have always been very supportive of me, and showed me varieties of postures modified so I can get the same benefits. They took the time to talk to me, and spent time with me after class to work with me a bit to make sure I can do these postures. \n\nMoksha is the first type of yoga that I can feel a great deal of cardio and strength, as well as setting my mind at ease. I found that I was able to really let go of my day and work through the poses and find an inner peace. I think this is what my friend means by spiritual. \n\nAs for the basics in Yoga, what I mean is that they give back to the community, they try to help make yoga available for everyone, and I didn't feel like I was just another dollar figure to them. They have Karma classes which makes the class only $5 to participate and they have a unique program available to trade working in the facilities for yoga classes.

I also completed 30 days from another clinic two years ago and lost 30lbs. \nInitially I made an appointment to talk to the doctor and he wasn't there so that was a wasted trip. I wanted to start the diet soon so I went to there north Las Vegas location to see the doctor sooner then waiting a week for him to return to the green valley location. Despite the fact that I told them I would be going to the green valley location only they assigned me a diet coach at the north location. When contacting him it always seemed like I was wasting his time so I stopped talking to him. The diet cost $900 for 43 days and after 7 days he never got back to me. They had a sale when I signed up, normal price is $1200. I finished the diet with good results but it had nothing to do with the overplayed diet coach. I find the HCG diet to be great but unfortunately you have to get a doctor to write the prescription for you so you have to go to a clinic like this.

I was at a complete stop when I was rear-ended at 35+ mph. My neck, shoulders, back, and arms were achy and had shooting pains. I had a constant headache until Torrey started treating me. Torrey is Ryne's older brother, and he's a miracle worker with my neck and shoulders.

Right after I wrote that not so nice review, I met with Dr Hunt. She answered all my questions, and I told her my husband and I were ready to start a fertility drug earlier than we had originally planned. I felt like she listened, and didn't think twice about trying to convince me otherwise. It was probably one of the best appointments I've had with her. \n\nSo really, my complaints aren't so much with her, or the niceness of the staff, its just about the way the office is run. \n\nI was supposed to start that medication today, but it was contingent upon my ultrasound results from yesterday. Dr Hunt's medical assistant was in the room while I was getting my ultrasound. I made it very to clear to her that I needed a call back from someone today because I needed to start the medicine on this exact date. She assured me Dr Hunt or herself would call me first thing in the morning.\n\nIt is now 420 in the afternoon and I just got off the phone with Erin (spelling?) in the front office....ONLY because I called to get my own info. Erin was great, answered my questions and gave me the go ahead to start the drug. Then she double checked to make sure I didn't have any other questions. \n\nI just don't understand why its so hard to get a call back? I really do like coming here aside from the long waits, and other complaints. Everyone is very nice and I would like for Dr Hunt to continue to be my OBGYN. Please, just manage the office better! \n\nI must also add, that my appointment was at 215 yesterday, I was in, out, and done with my ultrasound by 245. That was record timing.

EXCELLENT STAFF- RN's, CNA's, and doctors. \n\nThrough the years, I'd heard many good things about the Maternity department. I had pre-registered online in my 35th week (site is user-friendly- a plus)- there was a possibility mentioned by the High Risk Pregnancy Center, so I wanted to be prepared. Towards the last few days of week 35- on a friday, my OB-GYN advised me to go to the hospital because my BP was too high, 160s. \n\nI checked in, went into the surgery triage room, and waited for the perinatologist (high risk pregnancy center) to determine what to do next. The doctors and nurses (rn's- mary, nancy, chris, etc. & cna's) were all very nice- they would keep us informed. We were waiting to hear from the perinatologist who would do an ultrasound and a review of the recent findings (from the HRPC); finally it was determined- I was scheduled to deliver on sunday. The food (the solids, anyway) was pretty good, too. (Note: the night before my surgery, we were able to borrow a wheelchair so that I could get some fresh air outside- the grounds are beautiful.)\n\nI was able to get a room that night (all private?); mine had a view overlooking the valet and parking lot. The room was comfortable- a bed, a bedside table, several chairs- one that converted into a bed for the expecting father, a tv with a dvd player, a chest, a closet, and a bathroom. My husband brought me movies from home to watch, to keep me occupied. Housekeeping came daily, which was always a short visit. The hospital itself is very clean. And there was no weird creepy hospital smell either. \n\nI ended up staying a week (had never stayed overnight in a hospital before, nor had I been apart from my husband); though I had some little bumps (unfavorable medicine reactions- I am really sensitive and I had a lot of pain- I went through a lot). The nurses were right about encouraging me to walk the hallways, through my pain with the c-section surgery (it did get easier like they said), in order to get my system back to normal. I was under constant supervision- medicines, lots of monitoring- blood pressure, and testing- blood tests & 24 hour urine, so I wasn't able to get a lot of rest (plus my neighbors also had baby monitoring- the heartbeats were pretty loud). I was lucky if I had three hours straight sleep. I did receive excellent care, though I wasn't having the greatest time. Many doctors checked in with me- the doctors who delivered my son- Dr. Ghadisha & Dr. Maligaya, my own OB-GYN, Dr. Brathwaite (all with Southwest Medical Associates), and a couple other doctors I only saw once. \n\nThe nursery was excellent as well. Our son received round-the-clock care and attention- though he came early, he was born healthy and normal- we were very lucky. The nurse would get him- heavy security (a good thing), and we would be able to have him in my room as long as we wanted. \n\nOn the cafeteria food, the prices were pretty decent (minus the ice cream) and the food was pretty good, too. My husband went there many times, as he was here visiting me and the baby. BTW, Patients are not allowed in the cafeteria.\n\nI should mention that the other parents/patients on the floor, were all very nice, too. There were some patients who had a really long stay- 37 days, six months. So, yes, looking back, my week's stay seemed short, in comparison. One couple gave us their preemie clothes, three outfits, which was very nice. They were told they would be having a preemie, but they had a 8-pound baby.   \n\nMy few complaints: the overwhelming thing is that everyone would come to the room at the same time- felt a little bombarded at times: the photographer- Bella, the welfare clerk- this was a mistake, as I had double coverage, the clerk to get our medical insurance information, the breastfeeding nurse, etc. And possibly another thing that was beginning to irritate me, the subject of post-partum depression would keep popping up (it wasn't that, though, I was extremely weak- the liquid diet wasn't helping, the medicines were really affecting me, and I wasn't getting much sleep, either- I just wanted to go home and get back to some normal version of myself). I understand the concern, though. The checkout process was very long- over 5 hours. The nurse told us she had to complete lots of paperwork, and in the final hour before we were able to leave, we went through discharge directions, signed the forms, and were given the TDAP shots (3-in-1). We were also given some supplies as well.  \n\nTo recap- excellent care, staff, nursery, clean facility, nice private rooms for maternity patients, good food in rooms and cafe, pre-registration process is user-friendly.", "business_id": "XzInO2PCkP-e3_Y2dpYSRw", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-01-08", "type": "review"}

He was really nice and pretty insistent on some things that I wasn't fond of (full pap smear even though I had already had one recently, full breast exam even though I just had one, and full \"regular\" exam); THEN he finally got to the ultrasound.  He wasn't too great on giving me advice regarding my personal trainer (what I could and could not do anymore) which was really important to me.  He also didn't let me listen to the heartbeat for very long - (maybe 4 seconds literally) which was kind of a big moment for me!\n\nWhen did it get bad?  \n\nThe next day I got a call from EVDI for my mammogram.  I called them back (they had left a message) and asked, \"What mammogram?\"  They said, \"Dr. Layton ordered you a mammo for the lumps found in your left breast.\"  Well - that's news to me!!  So I called over to Dr. Layton's office to ask about it after canceling the order.  \n\nThe woman at the front desk said, \"Oh yeah, the nurse mixed up your charts and sent the wrong one to EVDI.\"  No apology.  No, \"We should have called you.\"  Nothing.  That's kind of a FRIGHTENING call to get, for one.

I asked why no one had come to let me know what was going on or to at least give me an update and he said \"well sorry\". What kind of medical doctor goes to school for 10 years and promises to help his patients but then turns them away because of a few F Bombs. Treat me with respect and maybe you would have received the same treatment. I might understand if the hospital was busy, but once again, I was the only patient on my floor and had 4 nurses listen to me complain and not get me temporary pain reliever! Worst hospital ever. They treat you like nothing, and only care about drugging you up to get you out. Courtesy of Obama Care and the lazy, useless, unprofessional, disrespectful members that follow him.

Every time you go there it appears that their MAIN concern is getting your $$$$. They ask for payment up front, even though we have full dental insurance, and they collect upfront which is unusual.

However WHILE MY CHILD WAS UNDER SEDATION, it was determined that some addtl. work needed to be performed. I agreed to this work. The doctor MENNA (the female dentist here)....wanted to STOP THE PROCEDURE and discuss financial arrangements OVER my child's head while he was being worked on. My husband snapped....totally unprofessional, totally inappropriate. It is CLEAR that the ONLY thing they CARE about is getting their hands on my money. Seriously? ALL of this conversation could have been done AFTER the work was completed on my son and we were leaving the office. You do not talk finances, financial arrangements or anything of the sort when you have a small child under sedation. As I said it's not like we were new patients. We had been going here since they opened. This conversation could have WAITED. I found that in the time I went there, that both the dentists first concern was getting your money. Period. Not patient care, and not acting professionally. This is a married couple. Obviously they have a long way to go in learning appropriate treatment standards of care for their patients. I will NEVER go there again, nor would I recommend them to anyone. If you don't mind being treated as nothing more than a wallet, even if you HAVE viable dental insurance coverage's be my guest.

The ER was the worse I have ever experienced.  I raised 4 kids did many ER visits and this was the first time I had ever needed to go.   I had a colonoscopy there on Monday, the next day I started bleeding non stop.  I ended up in the ER because I was beginning to lose consciousness.  Failure #1, I went to the triage desk and told the nurse my Dr. sent me here because I was bleeding and was about to pass out.  She gave me papers to fill out and sent me to the lobby.  I couldn't even sit up or I would get dizzy.  When my wife completed the paper work she called us back to her cubby hole and tried to get a blood pressure, she couldn't.  I told her 3 different times I was going to pass out and her response was \"Let's get your temperature\".  At that point I passed out and passed blood all over the floor.  Thank god my wife was there to catch me or I might have had a head injury to go with my bleeding.  When I started to come to I was on a gurney in a ER stall.  I could hear people talking.  The Dr. was asking for a blood pressure but they couldn't get one.  I knew I was alive because I could see the EKG monitor and I had a heart beat.  They started 2 I.V's,  one in each arm which made me freezing cold.  When they did finally get a blood pressure it was 58/44. I saw the nurse one more time after that.\nFailure #2. A little while later the Dr. came back in, and this was the last time I saw him, and said I had a vasovagal reaction from seeing my own blood.  What Dominican Republic Med School did he go to.  My Hemoglobin went from 15.9 and dropped to 9.2.  A drop of 40%.  Maybe, just maybe that might be the issue of passing out.\nFailure #3.  The gastroenterologist came by and ordered me to have a CT of the Abdomen and 2 fleets enemas to clean me out so he could see where I was bleeding from, while we waited for the colonoscopy team to come in.  The hour or so we waited for them to come in, nothing was done.  When my Dr. asked if they did the enemas, I told him no.  In disgust, he said to the team, \"this is going to be messy\".  They asked me to roll on my side and I asked if I should take my shorts off, which I had been laying in for the past 2 1/2 hours covered in blood.  The nurse just shook her head.\nFailure #4.  I was admitted for 3 days until my blood pressure would come back up.  With an I.V. in each arm they kept me on fluids.  They only used the left arm to put the fluids in.  Never flushed the right I.V. the entire time I was there.   When it was time to go home, they removed both I.V.'s.  This is where the failure comes in.  2 days later my arm was hurting and the vein was huge and tender.  A clot had formed in the right arm where the I.V. was.  I was instructed to take aspirin and apply heat to the area and it should go away.  Well, it never did and now the vein which was as large as a pencil is now a shriveled up hard vein the size of a pencil lead and useless.\nThese were just the main blunders of the hospital, I guess I should be thankful I made it out alive.  But as you can see I won't make the mistake of going back to St. Rose \"Duh\" Lima anytime soon.  I will take my chances of the 20 minute drive to Las Vegas to receive any care.\nTo be honest, the nurses on the floor were very friendly.  The place was clean and although I was only given clear liquids on the last day I was there, ice chips only before that, broth never tasted so good.", "business_id": "0_5w-MEtHerOiXf7rki08A", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-12-12", "type": "review"}

Last year I lived across the street from the NW Phoenix VA clinic.  I applied for care there, and was told I could not be seen there.  They were not taking new patients, as they had lost the services of several doctors.  I was told I might try the Phoenix VA Hospital.  I did and was given an appt almost 1 year from my call date.  My needs were not for a cold or a cut finger.  It was for Diabetes and I was told they could not see me sooner and that is how it was.  I felt something was strange with the entire experience.  I had to find private care, and even that was difficult in the area.  I could not retire in Arizona and the lack of health care was a big part of the reason, as I was going to need VA health care as I got older. Diabetes was not magically going away, it needed treatment.    They seemed to have no interest in seeing me.  I could not depend on that, so I have had to make other plans in life. I would not be able to retire in Arizona.    I think that is a shame in itself.  I realize everyone has a different experience, but I gave mine and it is a honest review of what happened to me in 2013.

After moving to Phoenix from Indiana, I was at a loss for finding a good therapist who would listen to me before and during the massage and was reasonably priced.\n\nIt was through Groupon that I found BackFit. Still I was leery. A cheap massage does not mean a good massage. I was happy to have my fears allayed.\n\nWhen I called to make my appointment, I'd thought that I might be put off since I was using a Groupon. The case was not so. Working with my schedule, I was able to get in within a matter of days.\n\nWhen I arrived, the front door was locked and I was concerned. But a nurse who was returing from her lunch hour, went ahead and unlocked the door early so I could wait for the therapist to return from her lunch. While I wasn't a chiropractic patient, the nurse was open and friendly.\n\nWhen the therapist did arrive, she was positive and upbeat and provided me with my paperwork, spoke with me regarding any issues I have and what I like concentrated on, and then we started the massage.\n\nThe room was softly lit and relaxing, a comfortably warmth (the day was chilly), and the therapist had a radio station playing lightly. Not the usual meditation music, which can be nice but also dull, but a classic rock station. I enjoyed the change up in music.\n\nMy therapist was talkative but not overly so. She discussed with me my health and back background, what I did for a living (sitting, standing, activity level etc), and shared light conversation about herself and the office. She focused on the areas I asked, then as time was winding down she asked what other areas I'd like worked on. She was very open to making sure my experience was as customized as I was willing to communicate with her.\n\nAfter the massage was over, I felt relaxed and she had relieved much of the tension and knots from my neck, shoulders, and back, as well as my feet, wrists, and hands (all my key focus areas). I will certainly go back to her in the future - Groupon or no Groupon.\n\nA bonus to my session was that, since I had used a Groupon for a massage, I was going to receive a free chiropractic consult. You can't beat that.\n\nAll-in-all, I would recommend BackFit Health + Spine. I will be returning as well.", "business_id": "k2ypC4kFCRQua1mOQpkBjg", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-12-20", "type": "review"}

She is also knowledgeable and friendly! I was in there my first time almost an hour as she did a very thorough job and took the time to explain things to me.  My prior hygienist barely spoke to me.\n\nThe first time I was examined by Dr. Chad Gubler.  He was friendly, told me about his background, and that he was in this office with his brother, and two of his other brothers were in another office. Lots of dentists in one family!  He asked if I had any questions, and really listened to me.  He didn't try to push sell anything on me, and suggested I get my wisdom teeth out. \n\nThe second time I went in, I took my son and saw Dr. Sean Gubler.  I had to switch due to the days that I am available. He had worked with children in the past, so this was a nice fit.  He sat and spoke with my son and didn't address me to answer for my son.  I liked that, as I am not sure what goes on in my son's mouth.  He was very friendly and professional.\n\nThe staff is nice, the location is convenient, except that you have to park at the rear of the building and take a really slow elevator up, but that's not Gubler Dental's fault.

For example, even for an Urgent Care, he is willing to prescribe medicines such as 12-20 count NORCO 5MG if he sees you have pain and it is obvious. Once again - these people are cautious an professional, if you're an addict: go somewhere else because I don't want you to screw it up for the rest of us.

I was impressed with the front desk staff, and their willingness to make sure that all my insurance ducks were in a row prior to my visit. 6 months later at my second visit, I discovered that the office was under new management. The physical experience of having my teeth examined was fine, and the hygienist who cleaned my teeth was delightful. However, I am EXTREMELY disappointed in the front desk service regarding my insurance and payment. I understand that the relationship between insurance companies and dentists' offices are complicated. And I read that signs that it is my responsibility to be aware of insurance changes. With that said:\n\n1) I had to call once to reschedule my appointment, then I called again to confirm my appointment. Neither time was I informed that there had been a change in management and that I should double check my insurance. \n\n2) It wasn't until I got into the office before it was explained that the insurance company would only pay 70% of my visit. And I can't help but to believe that it done by design knowing that I'd be less likely to cancel the appointment once I was there, than if I were informed over the phone.\n\n3) I just received ANOTHER bill from Dental Connections, which consequently, the insurance company did not pay 70% but in fact, I am ultimately responsible for 2/3 of the bill. So at my visit, I was informed INCORRECTLY of what my payment responsibility would be.\n\nListen, my teeth are fine, but I judge the quality of my healthcare by the front desk staff. Patients need to feel as if they have an advocate in navigating their healthcare and their insurance, and this experience has made me feel as though I have an opponent. In addition to dealing with the insurance company, I have to make sure that the actual dentist's office isn't taking advantage as well.

For the last two years now, she receives food, water and medication through a GI tube connected directly to her stomach.\n\nThis is all clearly spelled out in my mom's medical chart, yet the nurse who received my mom somehow missed this and forced her to take medication through the mouth. She only coughed out the pill several hours later. This, by itself, is ridiculous and intolerable but it's made even worse by the fact that my mom came to the hospital for treatment of her lung. This gross oversight made my mom's condition far worse than it had to be for the first day or so. Of course, I needn't mention the severe discomfort this put my mom through, having to deal with a pill and water stuck in her lungs.\n\nThis further underscores my review. The care at Southern Hills is inadequate at best. Once more, remember this is the behavior you can expect from the nurses that are supposed to be the cream of the crop, the ones charged with the care of the critical patients in the ICU.\n\nIt's so frightening that a nurse won't even read a chart before administering treatment.

The lady offered for us to come back to see if we could get a better facial shot. So that was great and super nice of her. \n\nWe went back on Tuesday and the ultrasound tech we had the first time we went (gender reveal) was there and she did our ultrasound. She did absolutely great!! We got to see his face more. And really got to see some great shots of our little guy. She's a really nice lady and really makes the experience so enjoyable.

Dr. Simms was available for a same day appointment and I scheduled with him for that afternoon. The wait time itself wasn't bad - 10-15 minutes after completing paperwork. \n\nDr. Simms was personable enough and after evaluating me, told me that he would like to treat for a sinus infection with antibiotics and prednisone. As I had just moved and newly became a student, I didn't yet have health insurance set up. Dr. Simms told me to give him a call the following week if the symptoms didn't subside after I was done with the meds, and he would prescribe an alternate antibiotic.\n\nI ended up going to a dental Urgent Care two days later on a Saturday because I woke up with immense pain and pressure in my tooth. An x-ray confirmed a sinus infection and I was told to follow up with my ENT on Monday. I called Monday morning and left a message for Dr. Simms. I called Tuesday and left another message since no one had called me back and I was in pain. Tuesday night, Dr. Simms' medical assistant called me back and told me that I had to come in to get a CT scan. I inquired about getting an additional rx for antibiotics as well as asked to discuss this with Dr. Simms directly. That request was ignored and I was told that she would attempt to book me for a CT scan and call back.\n\nTwo days later, I hadn't heard back and I called to leave another message. I was told that the medical assistant I spoke with no longer works there, so the receptionist or nurse had no idea what I was talking about. She told me she took down the message and I would get a call back. I stopped by the office later that day to drop off a copy of my x-ray and asked if Dr. Simms was in and if I could chat with him for a moment. I was told he was seeing patients and couldn't talk to me. Understandable, however I was willing to wait to get a word in with him. I was told again he wasn't available. When I explained the situation and that I had been struggling with this for three weeks and haven't been able to get a hold of him for a week at this point, the nurse/receptionist just shrugged.  I asked her to please have him call me specifically as I wanted to talk to my doctor directly. She told me someone would call me later. When I again insisted on a call from him specifically, she rudely told me again that \"*someone* will call\". \n\nI took my x-ray, booked an appt at a different office and left. I've never experienced such cold and indifferent treatment at a doctor's office. Who wants to be treated by a doctor who doesn't return calls and whose front office staff is rude and uncaring both in person and on the phone?

Pleasantly surprised, I smiled and bid the polite welcome desk receptionist \"good morning\" as I signed in for my appointment. \n\nTurning from the desk, I moseyed my way on over to the spacious waiting area. Surveying the modern furniture, artwork and decor I made my choice of where it was I wanted to relax in leisure while I waited to be called back to my appointment. Taking a seat in a plush brown suede armchair, I allowed my mind to wander as I sat contently in comfort and ease. Mesmerized by the freshly fastened redwood displays chock-full of the latest designer fashion eye wear, my eyes wandered from one pristine redwood display case to the next. How in the world was I suppose to choose just one pair, when I love them all?! The new eyewear display and all of its contents were by far one of the many perks of the new facility, in addition to the amiable staff of course. \n\nStanding to my feet, I allowed myself to window shop for the pair of glasses that I would purchase after my appointment. As I browsed the displays, the woman who was in charge of eyeglass fittings politely greeted me. She asked me if there was anything I was looking for in particular. I informed her that I already had my eye on a pair I liked. I then pointed them out to her. She gingerly removed the glasses from the display and told me she'd set them aside for me. Placing my soon to be lovely Lacoste glasses in a small red bin the woman smiled. Such a warm and friendly experience I've had thus far in the new office.\n\nA few minutes later I was called back into the examination room by a friendly doctor's assistant. Waiting for Dr. Sugarman in the exam room, the assistant and I made small talk about how school was going, and their new facility. By the end of our conversation Dr. Sugarman had entered the room; he greeted me with a wide smile and a hearty handshake. He, like the assistant, asked me how I was doing, and how \nschool was going. He even went as far as to share with me about his own undergraduate experience. Informing me that he was a UNC Charlotte Alumni (Go NiNeRs!) and had also studied abroad. After encouraging me to finish out my senior year strong and to go abroad, Dr. Sugarman had completed my entire eye exam. That was record time! Quick, easy, and painless! In the time it took for him to perform his complete eye exam and dilate my eyes, Dr. Sugarman had shared with me some of the most valuable information I'd heard all day. He shared with me that determination and dedication are key to success, and this was self-evident in both his undergraduate testimony, and the recent opening of this immaculate new facility. \n\nRemoving his gloves Dr. Sugarman washed his hands and courteously walked me to the check out desk. As I paid for my visit, Dr. Sugarman noticed that I didn't have any sunglasses with me. Jokingly, I informed him that I'd left my \"fly\" shades at home. With a chuckle he offered me the standard disposable sunglasses every optometrist's office gives you. Smiling he said, \"You're going to need these.\" In agreeance, I grasped the eyeglasses and giggled as I unrolled my latest fashion statement. With my glasses now securely wrapped to my face, I showed off my new style to Dr.Sugarman and the woman working the check out desk. Dr. Sugarman then shook my hand, wished me good-luck on my studies and to have a good afternoon. Wishing him the same, I made my way past the check out and welcome desk, past the mile-high walls of eye wear and through the door to the bright warm sunlight outside. Walking to my car I thought about how great this business really is. University Eye Associates has given me another wonderful experience with their  fast, friendly and superior service. I've never left any doctor's office so happy and at ease. I strongly recommend you, your family, and your friends all go to University Eye Associates. This office has the most friendly medical staff, a wonderful new selection of eyewear, and on top of all of that a brand new facility! It's a no Brainer...

I've been wanting to get LASIK for many years now (I got PRK instead). I finally decided to make the leap this year.   I found Dr. Abrams' office through my insurance.  My insurance does not cover this type of surgery, but through insurance,  I got an additional discount to pair up with my FSA. \n\nNow going into any surgery, you should very much so do a lot of research as to what you are getting yourself into.  Which is what I did.  So I went in knowing what to expect  on the differences between what surgeries are offered. Go in smart and expect the car salesman pitcht too (don't worry, not from the doctor).\n\nThis is a busy office and most patients in the office look like they are getting cataract surgery.  \n\nLet me share my experience and things that would hopefully organize this office for future patients.  \n\nI will say that the process going in was confusing for me.  My hopes for this office is to set up a better way to inform/educate your possibly new patients and make sure your office is on the same page.  Sometimes they asked for money before I received services, sometimes they asked for co-pay,  I was so lost and felt like I was being taken advantage of because I had no idea what I was expecting for that visit.   Patients make sure to raise questions.\n\nSOooo.   A smoother process for me, going in would have been: \n\nOffice questions /****Patient preparedness\n\n1.  If new patient, schedule to see if you are a candidate.  \n***It would be nice to let me know if there is a cost involved.  I did 2 preliminary visits.  First one was free, but this should be the time to give me pamphlets and educate me what will happen in future visits.  \n\nIf you wear contact, its best to be out of your contacts for at least 2 weeks to get the best read if you are a candidate.  \n ***Let patient know there will be a $150 fee for the assessment.  If you are a candidate and you opt for surgery, it will go towards your total.  Otherwise, its their $150.  \n\n2.  Arrival for testing.  Get tests done. Meet with the doctor so he can confirm if you are a candidate.  Then the doctor should go over what surgeries he can perform, what he would recommend, what pros and cons are of each, and  then at that time should also ask about daily activities/diet/etc so there can be a determination as to what surgery is best.  This first meeting with the doctor should be the breaking ice period.  Meaning as this is the doc/patient at ease mode.  \n***This part got skipped on me, but was the reason why I took an extra week to research things more.  I did meet with the doc, but luckily my fiance was there to raise questions he had on his mind.  Which after saying I do contact sports, that the best option for me was PRK.  I knew that was the best option for me, but they were selling me on the Keratome procedure because of the faster recovery time.  That procedure freaked out my finace  This was also the time the doc told me about Custom PRK/Lasik.  Remember patients, use this as your Q&A time.  Ask about possible complications, recover times, statistics, anything!  \n\nAfter speaking with the doctor was when I met with the consultant about the costs because I told the doctor I didn't know how much this would cost me to begin with.  \n***This should of at least been covered in my first preliminary visit (I had 2 preliminary visits).  They gave me the costs and I felt my money fall out my pockets. It is very costly.  So,  I had to sleep on it because it was a whole lot more than I was expecting and waiting it out as I have wouldn't make that much of a difference for me.  I was just trying to rush surgery because boxing blind or with glasses sucks & wearing contacts/glasses gets really inconvenient!  But really, I've been wanting this for the past 7 years now so I was a bit bummed.  I'm trying to prep for a wedding this year and every penny counts at the moment.\n\nAnyhow, with me passing up that day to do surgery,  they at least followed up with me the next week.  After discussing things I then called a few days later to go ahead an schedule my procedure.  \n\nScheduling was  a bit off because again, there seemed to of been a communication breakdown between staff and the doctor, then staff and scheduler.  I won't go into details that much, but after a few visits I was sort of prepared after being confused from day one.  \n\nSurgery went well. Its been a week so far, but I can already tell the difference.  Doc said it may take a few weeks for me to really see finer results with PRK.   I will say that Dr. Abrams took good care of me, and still is.  \n\nIts 3 stars for the overall experience of the office, not Dr. Abrams or my surgery.", "business_id": "OnX0jg0FmbwgBUhxVdKsmA", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-07-09", "type": "review"}

The paramedic informed the E.R. doctor (Dr. Grabert) that I was indeed having a stroke (obvious signs including no right hand control. difficulty speaking, excessively high heart beat and blood pressure) and the Doctor belittled the paramedic mocking him because he didn't go to medical school. He told the paramedic that I was having a panic attack and he was going to give me valum and send me home. He did just that, sent me home with no ability to move the right side of my body and unable to form a sentence. \n\nI was readmitted less than 48 hours later with signs of brain injury (excessive vomiting, severe dizziness, confusion). The hospital has NOTHING to amend their mistake and has been sending me bill after bill for the following week I spent in the hospital (despite having adequate insurance coverage).

As stated in every piece of stroke literature; if a stroke goes untreated for an hour, it will cause permanent damage or even death.

I wanted to give my teeth a generous amount of time to settle as much as possible so I could give a fair review. Hopefully the details here will help educate others so they can have a better outcome than I did. \n\nThe Situation: I had two molars with large, old metal fillings that needed to be either re-filled, or likely crowned. I had no pain, no infection, no bite issues, perfectly functioning teeth, just needed to be replaced to prevent future issues. I was going to go with traditional crowns. But my boyfriend had gone to Dr. Miller about two years ago for Cerecs, the \"one day\" ceramic crowns. They are supposed to save precious tooth structure as they are really bonded onlays instead of wrap-around crowns, and supposedly don't require the shaving down of the tooth that traditional crowns do. I called Miller's office and got a consultation. He was very high on the whole Cerec technology and so, did not discuss any downside to the Cerecs. I decided to give it a try.  \n\nThe Procedure: Cerecs are NOT like traditional crowns. You are permanently bonding ceramic material to your tooth, so it has to be perfect, which involves grinding out the old fillings and prepping the teeth, dusting titanium dioxide powder on the tooth surface, digital 3-D cameras, designing the new onlays with a computer then cutting the onlays in the machine (waiting time), then the first fitting, then baking (more waiting time), then fitting again, build up, bonding, and finishing. And the material is ceramic, not porcelain like traditional crowns, so it cannot be polished once the surface is adjusted, so the surface is not smooth like a real tooth or like a traditional crown. This is important. \n\nBetween the constant pulling on my lip with various tools and the rough treatment during the grinding out of the old fillings, for the first time in my dental patient career, I ended up with a bruised and raw inner lip, badly scraped gums around the new onlays, really messy. Because it took so long in between the first numbing and when they actually bonded the final onlays (he overbooks), I had to be numbed up twice. \n\nFOUR HOURS after I arrived at his office, he was finally done. In pain and pretty shaken up, I was wisked up to the front office and promptly seated in a chair and asked for my credit card. No, \"how are you?\" or \"how did it go?\" I think they didn't need to ask as I suspect they already knew that it usually doesn't go very well.\n\nThe Outcome: After the first adjustment is when the severe jaw pain started. Miller said that he would do \"whatever it takes\" to get the bite right. I came back a second time and found out what he meant...he started grinding down the teeth AROUND the crowns, including teeth that were no where near the area he worked on. Then my bite was REALLY off.  I told him to just stop. Why was he grinding down my other teeth when the only things that changed in my mouth were his two crowns? He pronounced his crowns as \"perfect\" so it must be that all my other teeth are the problem? Really? He's a nice guy, personality-wise, but this was ridiculous.\n\nThe Aftermath: Because of the bite now being really off, the jaw muscle pain escalated to my throat and neck, along with the tooth pain. I was referred to another dentist from a good friend who really helped me ease the muscle pain. He did not criticize Miller, but nor was he pleased with what he saw; not the margins, the anatomy of the teeth (they are almost without any edges for biting), nor with his grinding down of my good teeth around the crowns. \"It's not like a haircut\" he said. \"They won't grow back.\" Luckily, the pain has subsided, but the wide margins will remain for good. Bottom line: Be very cautious with Cerec technology and the dentist who administers it. Or better yet, just go traditional if you can.", "business_id": "1EijFh9CwBquhE25Vmpekw", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-07-11", "type": "review"}

Now that I'm more or less on my own, I also needed to find one that accepted my dental insurance (Delta Dental). All of my old coworkers go to a Dentist in Old Town but their hours did not work for me. I don't like taking time away from work for an appointment unless it's necessary. \n\nI turned to Yelp and came across Sonoran Desert Dentistry. I saw that Dr. Parsanko had a lot of great reviews and noticed that some of the people I know are patients of his. I also loved that he had late hours on Tuesdays and Thursdays so I made an appointment right away. It was pretty easy to schedule an appointment for the time that I wanted. I originally made the appointment because I was having some tooth aches. When I made my initial appointment, I told them that I would make another appointment later on for my regular check-up since I was still a few months early. \n\nThey use a cool program that sends you texts before your appointment comes up so that you can confirm and be reminded of it. I'm really good at keeping my calendar organized but this is great for those who aren't. A few hours before my appointment Rhonda called and asked if I could come in earlier because of a cancellation and that I could also do my regular check-up at the same time. How convenient! \n\nThe office was easy to find and the waiting room is really nice although I didn't have to wait long. Dr. Parsanko took my x-ray and was with me pretty much the whole time (just like everyone else said). He's very knowledgeable and I can tell that he has a lot of experience. When you check-in, you can get a free bleaching kit. I was a little nervous that it wasn't 100% free, thinking, what's the catch? But there was no catch. In fact, every time I go back, I can get one tube of bleach for free. \n\nI have already recommend Dr. Parsanko to a friend and her family because I have nothing but positive things to say about him and his practice. I'm so glad that I found a Dentist that I really like and trust so close to my work and home. I never make follow-up appointments for anything because I'm not sure if I liked who I saw or may not have had a great experience with their office but when I was asked if I wanted to make my next appointment, I said yes!", "business_id": "wi6-9GyhR3srZ8NodhVcDA", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-11-09", "type": "review"}

Are they being removed? I received \"treatment\" here over a year ago. I feel like such a fool for falling for this, that I'm almost too embarrassed to write this. \nLike many, I was desperate to get allergy relief. It's amazing what desperate people will believe when they are seeking help. I had been suffering from seasonal allergies for years and had tried many treatment types. But, the worst issue I was having was my allergy to cats. This is what brought me in. \nI came in, paid the fees, and they gave me a \"complementary\" Detox Foot Spa, which is a known scam. It's a simple reaction, really, but it certainly doesn't detoxify anything. You get the same dirty looking water even if you never place your feet in the water, due to oxidation. Either this clinic is ignorant to this fact, which is bad, or they know it's a scam and they sell it to their customers anyways, which is worse. \nWhile my feet soaked, I was told to watch a video about the allergy treatment to save the doctor time on explaining it to me. I spoke with the doctor, and explained that my reason for coming in was a cat allergy. I knew that each treatment was $98 and the first visit alone was $240. I got the scam foot bath, this silly balancing thing where I sat on a bouncy yoga ball and they told me I had poor balance, and magically I did. Then they \"reprogrammed\" me and magically I had better balance. The power of persuasion. I feel so silly. \nBTW - I told them I was NOT interested in the foot bath, or any of the other services they wanted to charge me for for this itemized first visit. I simply wanted to be treated for cat allergies. They had lengthy reasons for why this was not possible. Scams always do. So, $240 later...\nThey tell me I'm allergic to milk, and about 10 other things I've never had a reaction to. I say okay, that's interesting. I guess that's possible. Then they tell me that I can only treat one allergy at a time and that each visit will cost $98. I knew the treatment would be $98, so I say alright. I tell them at this time, I would just like to be treated for my cat allergy. Magically, I get some long answer as to why this is not possible and that I must treat many other allergens first before \"cat\" can be \"reprogrammed\". Huh? I should have known then. I was also told that they don't have any clue as to when I should start seeing relief from allergies treated and that it can take more than one treatment on each allergy to make it work. \nEverything seemed to make sense at the time, which is why I feel so duped. There's no scientific evidence behind any of this. Just a \"wow, isn't western medicine ridiculous. Insurance only pays for treatment, not prevention. Our clinic is more enlightened than all that\" attitude. Which I ate up, since I tend to agree. \nThere's many \"clinics\" (sorry for using quotations so much) that claim they can solve our health issues. Most are scams. Clues are: that you MUST have this initial visit in which they charge just enough to get you feeling committed (I've already paid $240, I can't stop now!) and you end up throwing good money after bad. This initial visit suspiciously includes things that you didn't want or need, but that they tell you are necessary. Then myriad visits after that are required, all of which cost just enough so they get a hefty profit and you can still afford it. Lastly, they tell you (as with all medicine) that there are no guarantees. If their treatment didn't work, it must be something else that's the culprit. A refund is never even an option, as you go into it knowing you are at their mercy. \nSave your money and spend more on eating healthy and getting exercise. I bet that will do wonders on your health, And THAT IS a guarantee.", "business_id": "TRi3UlrRiHiG27DfcjIU3w", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-03-22", "type": "review"}

Apparently, I needed to get all my fillings replaced and that I needed some sort of ultrasonic specialized cleaning techniques because I had peridontal disease and all sorts of eyebrow raising b.s.. \n\nI proceeded with the cleaning which was done in a cursory fashion. There was absolutely no real scaling done and a very cursory cleaning (just some crap polish job which didn't even clean up some of the stains on my teeth). The dentist didn't bother to check up on the bad job done by the hygienist.\n\nI never returned despite phone calls and email reminders.\n\nI went back home to my dentist who did a full check up on me and all my fillings were fine. I had no peridontal disease and my hygienist actually appropriately scaled my teeth properly (which is what you really are paying for when you get a cleaning), got rid of all of my stains. No crazy ultrasonic technique necessary. The dentist checked my hygienist's work and told me to follow-up in 6 months.\n\nThe scary thing about dentists are you don't know really what you are getting into and place a lot of trust in them to do the job they are supposed to do. A good dentist should always check on their hygienist's work to ensure proper scaling was done because that is what a \"dental cleaning\" is supposed to do.", "business_id": "uR-9YnrohwOZ5Q1lLUc8Wg", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-07-10", "type": "review"}

I've had the privilege of seeing them both over the years and they're very professional, thorough and very good listeners.\n\nBut the reception/ nursing staff at this location leaves much to be desired.  Over the years it's become increasingly frustrating dealing with whomever answers the phone for appointments.  I have always gotten the impression of tired, confused and unsympathetic staff here and this past week was really the last straw.\n\nI tried getting a sick appointment here for five days now.  Last week I called and was put on hold - as is common practice there.  I waited five minutes and then hung up, as is common practice for me when I get put on hold.  (I can count on being on hold for at least two minutes when they have to ask me to wait, and that's at least half the time.  I can count on waiting, and I usually plan to wait, on hold and then have to hang up and call back later at least half the time I try to make any kind of appointment.)\n\nI called the next day - again put on hold.  Thought maybe I could make it through the weekend with my symptoms, so I didn't call back again.  Of course, the weekend arrived and I'm sick as a dog, but going to urgent care is expensive and there is no telling what the wait time is going to be, so I wait until Monday.  Called around 9am and was told they are booked up for the day but I should be sure to call back at 8am, when the office opens, the next day and I should be able to get in.  \n\nCalled back the next day at 8:30am --- I know, it's not 8am, but I wanted to get up and see how I felt before deciding I should see the doctor.  A different nurse tells me they're booked up and I should try to call back at 7:30am, which is when they start answering the phones.\n\nWhat?  They start answering the phones at 7:30am?  If I had known that, I could have planned to call earlier.  Previously I had been told to call no earlier than 8am?!  Now I'm sick, it's the holidays and I'm dealing with misinformation from an unprepared and disorganized reception/ nursing staff --- again.  This kind of thing is a common occurrence at this office, though, and I'm kicking myself because I should have known better than to completely trust what one person tells me there.\n\nAt least the second time around I got someone who reminded me I could try the new clinic at Target for a sick evaluation.  The day before, when I asked what my options were to see someone else immediately, the nurse told me I had no other options other than my primary care doctor.\n\nThese are trained professionals working in the health field?  I wish they could do better because I'm considering other primary care options in the future.", "business_id": "uZZ16LwUvXMZnZF8Q4Y2Zg", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-12-31", "type": "review"}

Dr. Brian did some testing to see if I did need the deep cleaning and he agreed that I did not. He saved me quite a bit of money.

I am very pleased with the service that was provided to me all the way from scheduling the appointment to the selection of frames.\n\nScheduling my appointment was extremely easy. I found Optic Gallery while looking through my insurance's list of in-network providers. My insurance provider showed that Optic Gallery had online booking available and I used that option. The online booking takes you to a 3rd party website called ZocDoc. From there the online booking was extremely easy and straight forward. I was able to see what days and times were available at a glance and was able to quickly pick a date/time that worked into my schedule.\n\nAfter my appointment was confirmed, I was also able to download all the new patient forms ahead of time. There was no need for me to have to show up 15mins prior to my appointment just to fill out paperwork.\n\nOnce I got to the office, the atmosphere was very relaxing and the office was very well laid out and welcoming. You are welcomed to various designer frames and instantly know you will not have a problem finding frames that will be able to match your style.\n\nAs soon as I walked into the office I was greeted by one of the very friendly office staff who was already expecting me. They had my new patient file already to go and since I had filled out all the forms ahead of time, check in time was minimal.\n\nWhile I was waiting for my exam, I noticed one of the office staff assisting a young patient learning to put contact lens in for the first time. She was extremely compassionate and patient while the young patient got the hang of correctly managing her contacts. This put me at ease and foreshadowed the quality of care I could expect to receive.\n\nDuring my exam, Dr Wess Jordan listen very intently and let me ask all the questions I had and bring up all concerns that were raised to me by previous Optometrist. After doing a very thorough patient history he did the various eye exams to cover all of the concerns that I had raised. He was very informative about my current vision, the concerns I had raised, and the various options I had to correct them.\n\nOnce all my options were provided to me, they allowed me to make my own decision and wasn't pushy to take any route that was not in my best interest both medically and financially. He really was concerned with what was going to work with me.\n\nWhen it came time to pick frames the same lady that was helping the young patient earlier assisted me in picking out my new frames. There were a large selection of frames to choose from, but she was able to narrow down my selection and explained how certain types of frames would work better based on my style.\n\nAt the time of check out, she broke down each out of pocket cost and explained exactly what my insurance company was going to cover. There was no sticker shock and I knew exactly what my money was paying for. I don't feel like I paid for anything that wasn't actually done.\n\nI highly recommend Optic Gallery to anyone looking to have an eye exam done. They are a one stop shop and their patient care is top notch.", "business_id": "ybR-1WY58z22MGFLkkcnAQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-03-30", "type": "review"}

There is usually a steady entering of people coming to discuss your procedure and answer questions so write them down before you get here, because if you are like me it quickly escapes your memory when they ask if you have any questions. \n\nThe waiting room is very large and has regular size chairs as well as a few small benches. If you have other small children accompanying you then this bench is great for sleepy children. \n\nthe lounge area has 2 tables with chairs if you would want a table for eating or computer. also one table has a few electrical outlets for recharging your cell battery or computer laptop.  They have a free machine that can make different kinds of coffee, hot tea and even hot chocolate. There is also a TV in this area.\n\nThe bathrooms are very large but are single file type so gotta wait if in use.\n\nthe cafeteria downstairs is renovated and I am sorry that I cant tell you about the food there because it closes at 2pm! after lunch SO if your procedure is scheduled around lunch time then people who are allowed to eat should keep this in mind!\n\nALSO keep in mind parents that if you are being admitted to HEMBY you may want to move your car from the orthopedic hospital parking deck to the main hospital during the time your child is in surgery. I get lost trying to maze my way through the hospital so I have to walk around the outside. And if you are by yourself at the hospital then you will be walking with your child to their room.\n\nthe recovery room is typical, except that the pediatric \"cubbies\" are right next to the automatic door which is very loud when people come in and out.\n\nNOW onto the main hospital:\nWe have usually always been admitted to HEMBY, which has its own elevator near the parking garage entrance to the hospital, take note that the entrance to the cafeteria is also near here.\n\nHemby is a very nice place, there is a lot for your kids to do if able, playroom, birds to look at in there little glass houses. the rooms are typically adorned with a DVD player and movies are available to borrow. a fridge and microwave in some rooms too. which is great if you have a small one you cant leave.\n\nNow on this visit we were actually in the NEW Hemby overflow which is accessed by the B elevator located directly behind receptionist in main lobby. These rooms are large and have the sleeper sofa, but down fall is no fridge or microwave. but there is a TV of course with a vcr/dvd player. \n\nThe food service person will visit you on the next food serving time and get your order for the next meals. The menu they give you is the one you will be making choices from for you stay. There is a lot to choose from. and as a parent I enjoyed that I didn't have to leave my child to go hunt food.\n\nthe nurses have been awesome and respectful of listening to my instructions for how to care for my son. They are helpful to make sure his pain is under control and get whatever I need. \n\nFOOD Room served: not so bad! let me say that condiments help a great deal and this hospital uses mainly Kraft products (BBQ sauce, dressings, mayo) in the cafeteria you can get hot sauce, tartar sauce, creamers (flavored). of course salt and pepper.\nthe mac and cheese is surprisingly great! just a little salt and pepper! The salads are filling. the chicken fingers remind me of Arby's breading. The flank steak with baked potato was edible, a little dry on the meat but hey it was free. The baked herbed chicken breast was also a little dry but very good. Breakfast was the best I think, I had eggs, bacon, sausage and grits. \n\nCafeteria- salad bar is paid for by WEIGHT so keep that in mind. they now have sushi available, fruits, pastries and the hot section is per item unless you get the special. (like bacon is 49 cents a slice!). burgers are OK, i usually hit it with some of the seasoning salt used for the fries. which are great when first made. They have pizza, soups and sandwiches and this place opens late hours also. \n\nGift shop has a lot to offer, snacks, headache meds, stomach meds, chap-stick. perfume, flowers, nice gifts, books, magazines. and extremely helpful staff.\n\nATM is located on the first floor but the cafeteria and gift shop do take credit/debit cards so if your card is NOT signed be prepared to show ID, it is their policy! \n\nSo if you should be admitted to the children's sections of the hospital I hope you a speeding recovery and a pleasant experience like I have received many times.", "business_id": "Vmw4amlubvfDnIpkegvKKw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-12-17", "type": "review"}

Although there are reviews for this office they are over a year + old so here is a current one. \n\n I took my daughter here for an issue she had from a previous dentist and the doctor we saw was OK BUT the billing practices are to say the least questionable! I gave them my insurance information on the spot and was told they would get back to me on the cost of the work that my daughter needed to have done. Later that evening I actually received a call from the office requesting I pay my deductible right then. I advised I would not do that and wanted to wait to see what the actual bill came to after going through my insurance but they insisted it was a \"fee for service\" based office and I needed to make that payment. \n\nI obliged and sent in a check for the full deductible against my better judgment and I WAS  RIGHT!  A few days later I got an explanation of benefits from my provider that stated the \"contracted and allowed amount\" was only 1/2 of what they charged me for. After a lengthy and frustrating call to their \"office manager\"  she insisted I was incorrect that they had a \"fax\" that showed what I should pay \"if I came in she could show it to me and go over it with me\" and I would have to call my provider. So, as if I get paid to do their job,  I took time from my own business to do their job and spoke with my provider and again I was RIGHT. \n\nThey are trying to charge me for charges that were not allowed by my provider..... When they finally  receive their copy of the explanation of benefits (not a generic fax) they will see they were incorrect. Now, lets just see if they make right with me and refund me the amount I overpaid. \n\nKeep in mind the next visit they wanted me to just hand over  $ 617.00 because they said that is what that charge will be...

The people there are sympathetic and seem to care about what they are doing, and making sure that you are comfortable. There was one area where I thought they really stood out: I lost my job last year, and had trying for months to get my family into one of the local sliding scale clinics so that we could afford doctor visits and meds, only to be told that none of them were accepting new patients. The social worker at CMC took the matter into her hands, made a couple of calls, and got us in, which was a huge relief.

After only a few hours post-op, I was able to see road signs and my clock from my bed, which were things I could never do before. The next morning, I went in and the eye exam revealed that I had gone from 20/600 (-5 in both eyes, one which had astigmatism) to 20/20!   \n\nInitially, they gave us a 10% discount, but I had received an email about procedures being 20% off over the summer, so I asked them for an adjustment. The amount for the entire procedure ended up being around $3,500. A friend of mine flew to Korea for her procedure and paid $1,400 for her flight and another $1,800 for her IFS LASIK procedure, but if I were to do it all over again, I would choose to go back to the LASIK Vision Institute in a heartbeat. \n\nMy husband was really pushing me toward PRK, but I chose LASIK because I did not have the recovery time (they said it would be 2-3 weeks vs a few days) and still, if I were to do it all over again, I would choose LASIK. I had minimal discomfort and dryness and I opted not to pay for the permanent punctal plugs. I used the prescribed eye drops, which cost me $80 at Walmart, quite liberally. I will say that they cause a strange metallic aftertaste that is appalling, so be forewarned.  \n\nI was concerned with the blurring in one eye that kept coming and going, but I have read that it is normal. I also had some ruptured blood vessels from surgery, which are now gone. Surprisingly, I've had minimal dryness compared to what I was expecting. You know, like having dry eyes while wearing contacts. Even the Acuvue Oasys brand contacts would cause great discomfort. An optometrist basically told me I shouldn't wear contacts at all because my blood vessels were growing toward my corneas, so glasses were the only option for me. I'm in my early 30's and I don't know why I didn't have LASIK sooner. Also, the halos they warned about don't seem any different from what I experienced with glasses. \n\nI'm thrilled. My husband says that there is a glow about me and honestly, I feel liberated. No more smudged glasses or crooked glasses, worrying about getting them knocked off of my face, or fumbling for them upon waking up.\n\nMy only gripe with this facility is that they scheduled a bunch of us for \"surgery\" at 9AM. The receptionists seemed to spend more time in the back of the office than the front. I waited until 2PM. The procedure itself lasted only 15 minutes. As we sat, nervously waiting in a dark room in our ridiculous garb (a hair net and some shoe covers), we were reassured that all we needed to do was stare at a light during the procedure. Dr, Kownacki performed the procedure and again, repeated that all I needed to do was stare at the light. The procedure itself is indescribable and there was slight pressure due to the suction and speculum. He must have done a fantastic job because during my post op, the person who examined my eyes said he could barely tell that the procedure had been performed. \n\nI know there are a lot of horror stories out there. I read a ton of reviews before deciding to go through with the procedure. The consent forms I signed at the office also caused my stomach to churn. However, nothing in life is without risk. Do your research, ask questions, and negotiate the price of your procedure.

More injections and another half hour break. This happened again, then she finally started drilling. I could still feel it, but I had given up. At her rate my tooth wouldn't have been done until the following christmas. \n\nWhen I finally received my crown, it was placed, and I thought it felt odd.

I was super impressed with what I learned and saw during that visit and I became a fan back then even before I had children of my own.\n\nThe next two visits were more recent emergency visits with my son... One for Croup and the other for a night terror (of course I didn't know either diagnosis until after the fact).  Both times the lines to get in to see a doctor were rather long.  However, once we did get in, we were very happy with the level of service provided.  Courteous staff and attentive doctors and nurses.  We found them all to be patient as well, which is tough when you know they are constantly dealing with sick or injured children.\n\nPCH has a reputation for being the best in Arizona for a reason... the name speaks for itself.\nFrom the colorful curtains in each room to the movies playing on TVs throughout the lobbies and individual rooms, toys for children to play with as they wait to be seen, etc... They even offered my son stickers as we were leaving.  I am a fan of this place and I like knowing that it's nearby.  That being said, I hope that I won't have to visit PCH again ever.

After I switched insurance, I made a specific trip there to give them my new card so things would go smoothly, then got a bill from them and had to go back and explain that they billed the old insurance.  I work in medicine & know shit happens, so I went in there not really bothered, but when I walked to the front desk and said hi, the receptionist made an annoyed face and kept typing for another 10 seconds before asking what I needed.  I was furious at that point and asked to speak to the office manager, and she just slapped a piece of paper on the counter and said I needed to write my complaint down (I'm guessing from that, they're used to complaints).  When I ignored the form and explained my bill, she said they had billed my insurance right, and then someone who was likely the manager materialized, apologized, and said they would rebill my new insurance.  Last visit, I told the receptionist I had an appointment to get to & could I just get in and get my prescription really quick?  She shrugged in a bored way and said she didn't know how long it would take.  When 25 minutes past my appointment went by and I was thinking of leaving, the nurse came up and said she thought I had no-showed and she happened to find my file.  Front office clearly can't communicate and no one is holding them to doing their job competently.  The nurse was great and got my prescription as fast as she could, but there is absolutely no reason for her to sweat and stress because someone else can't do their job right.  The only reason at all they get one more chance is because it's super close to me and the nurse had a fantastic attitude.

I can't I have to write this review about a place I used to love. \nI just checked and in October 2014 I wrote a 5 star review... little did I know that a few weeks later I would be treated so poorly. \n\nTowards the end of November I received a call from someone in the office. (Unfortunately, I don't remember her name) She explained that my Pap Smear had come back abnormal and that I needed to come in for another procedure (Colposcopy). When I asked how much the procedure was for she told me that with my not having met my insurance deductible for 2013 year it would be around $200. I explained that I did not have $200 at the current time and that I would like to wait until January to have this procedure if possible, so that I could save up the money and also so that it would go towards my deductible for the whole year (2014). She seemed aggravated by my reply and hastily informed me that I needed this procedure as I probably have cancer. And this is not something I should be putting off. I told her that I didn't have a choice and this is what I had to do at the moment. I informed her I would call back in January.\n \nFortunately, for me I've had a very similar situation happen to me when I was 20 years old, so I am aware that often doctor staff is not well versed in explaining procedures to patients. I was a little shocked that she would basically threaten me with cancer, but also tried to understand that she was hopefully just looking out for me. I'll be honest I found her to be incredibly rude and had considered writing this review at that point. The holidays got in the way I let it go. \n \nOn Jan 15 when I called to discuss scheduling my appointment, I was pretty shocked to learn that the doctor had dropped me as a patient and that I would have to see if she would consider taking me back on. The girl was a lot nicer this phone call, but I was furious. I have been a patient for a few years and I was very upset to have to go through the horrible process of trying to find a new lady doctor. \n \nThis is outrageous to me and honestly if this is how they run their business I don't want to be a patient. I feel like the doctor/staff only care about my getting cancer if I am able to schedule my appointments at their convenience. If this was such an important procedure for me to have, you would think the doctor herself would have contacted me.  \n  \nPersonally, I think it is inappropriate for anyone other than the doctor to be discussing whether or not I may have cancer with me over the phone. That is a very scary thing to tell someone and I don't think it should be thrown around so lightly. Clearly the patients are not that important. \n\nIt's a shame because I really liked Dr. Haydee Docasar and thought that I had found a permanent OBGYN. I'm really disappointed that I have to find a new one.", "business_id": "kxvAGgF_DHgvN3U1WR5b1w", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-02-06", "type": "review"}

I am new to the area and trying to do research of where to go.  Wasn't very many reviews on this center so I figured I would take my chances.  The center was able to get me in the same week.  I waited 1 1/2 hours to see the doctor after my schedule appointment time.  I was with the doctor for 2 hours going over my history and symptoms. He put me on their \"protocol\" for fibro.  I was to start a gluten-free, dairy-free diet and start several supplements along with the CMO.  I was planning on spending $200 because the CMO was $150 and reviews seemed to be promising.  I ended up spending $429 on the supplements and visit. I was charged $479 on my credit card.  When I questioned the office he told me that he would credit back the $50 and wasn't sure why it charged that....hmmm.  That seemed pretty fishy to me.  After a few days the credit still didn't appear.  I called and questioned them again.  He told me that it would take up to two weeks to process and that he would call his Quickbooks support and find out.  I begun to believe that it was fishy.  Now it has been two weeks and nope still no credit.  I had to file a complaint with my credit card company.\nAs far as the supplements and diet helping with my fibro, I have not noticed any difference.  It has only been two weeks and I was told it would be one to two months before noticing changes.  I will update on whether or not the \"protocol\" works.  I will not be going back for a follow up because if they are going to try and rip me off once they will do it again.  I will get my supplements from a health food store and order the CMO online if I notice a difference.", "business_id": "MAxR-mDIBZheWste_0qcaQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-01-21", "type": "review"}

The workers are also genuinely accommodating and nice. But let me tell you about Dr. Edwards. :) My mom was the last patient yesterday for her dental surgery and we were given prescription for pain meds and anti-bac meds. We went straight to the pharmacy but unfortunately, they were unable to give us the pain meds because the prescription was not on a tamper proof paper (A new policy established this month). I was panicking because my mom was for sure going to be in pain and needed the meds. I knew the office was closed but I still called and on the voicemail, it stated another alternate number. I called and on the second ring, Dr. Edwards picked up! He was polite, friendly & suggested a non-prescription medication my mom could take instead. He was so specific & detailed & I couldn't be anymore thankful. My mom (when she was able to finally comfortably talk) even told me that after her almost 3-hr surgery, Dr. Edwards gave her a hug. What a sweet gesture! My mom truly appreciated it. \n\nAs someone who works in the healthcare industry, I'm often critical at how healthcare professionals treat my mom since we've had our share of bad experiences. But I definitely recommend Smiles Dental Group for your dental needs. It's rare to experience such good medical or dental services nowadays and I'm just glad my mom was/is in good hands.

Read the other reviews if you want to have a good sense of what to expect in terms of the differences between this and say, massage envy.\n\nThat said, I feel sorry for people who had a less than positive experience here, because it is such a gem in my life. I know I can go in here and spend $30 plus tip and have a deeply healing massage from someone who is working their butt off to make my body feel better. It is a mystery to me how the reflexology works, but I don't care! I have gone in with everything from a really sore achilles tendon to a tweaked neck and have always left with a great improvement. The last time I went I could barely walk without a limp going in because my achilles was so sore, and after they did their work, the next day it was like nothing had ever been injured. During the massage I had to kind of breathe through the part that involved rubbing it, because it was so sore, but it took care of the problem and then some.\n\nI also took my good friend with me last time, who was visiting from out of town. She is a body worker in a very prestigious spa catering to celebrities and others who can afford the best of the best. She was really impressed with the level of care and attention.\n\nThe only negative I can see to this place is that there can be a small language barrier if you are asking for something out of the ordinary, and also, it isn't the type of massage everyone is going to love. If you're elderly aunt just wants to have her shoulders lightly rubbed with lavender body oil, this may not be the best choice.

I made appointments with three different MT's to assess several practices in the Phoenix metro.  Mojo Physio and their Neuromuscular Release Therapy is one of the best!  Chad worked on me and I felt great relief afterward.  The office is not fancy but it is professional and comfortable (way more important than fancy for me), there is one big room with tables, the MT's work at each table.   I look forward to working with these folks further in the future to help me stay pain free as I age.  Thank you for your service!", "business_id": "lyxMHhtCHFeir4mVv6gb_A", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-08-17", "type": "review"}
