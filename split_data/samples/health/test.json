Southern Hills would rather take the extra cash that they can and disregard both negotiated discounts rather than be ethical.

I would hate for someone else to unknowingly experience what I have gone through the last week. Ever since Dr Gardner left we have had new doctors to see, finally settling with Dr Gillespie at this location. I have seen him several times, and realized he has a much more aggressive approach. Many times I have left feeling a little \"worked over\" But due to their great payment structure, it is a good deal for me, so I have continued to go. Last Tuesday I went in for my usual adjustment, as he was doing the side adjustment, I felt something kind of twinge, but it was not unusual to be in a little pain after his adjustments , so  he finished and I left. AS I went to get in my car and moved my right arm to put my purse over in the passenger seat, I got a very sharp pain in my right side. I hoped it was just a fluke thing , so I drove home. It became apparent that something was really wrong. SO I called Jaina and told her I thought maybe my rib was popped out or something , that I was in a lot of pain . She was very helpful as usual and suggested I come back in so he could try and fix it. I did, and as he tried to \"massage\" the area, IT was incredibly painful to the point that I was in tears. HE said it seemed as if he \"irritated the intercostal nerve\" . HE suggested I put ice on it, and if it was not better to come back tomorrow. \nIt was not better, but I certainly was not going to go back and go through that again. \nI contacted the area manager Mark and explained what had happened. I told him I was not comfortable going back to Dr Gillespie, so he set it up for me to go be evaluated by another Dr at another location. I did that as well. This Dr was polite and professional and did a basic examination and said that he believes it is a \"level 2 sprain\" That without me paying to get get something such as a CAT scan, that was his best determination. I do not have the money for expensive diagnostic testing, that is what led me to the Joint was a cheaper price, but I guess you get what you pay for. HE explained that this kind of thing happens sometimes when doing manual manipulation. and that is why I signed the \"informed consent\" I do not ever remember signing anything that said I could walk away from an adjustment being injured, and have asked for a copy of that, but as of yet not received it. I also have seen chiropractors for years, and never been hurt. \nThe other Dr told me the good news was it would heal. Yes I suppose that is better than not healing, but that does not help that I am in pain  now . I have difficulty doing most everything, as most movements require your abdominal muscles. I have even tried driving with only my left hand, but certain movements with my left arm even trigger that.    I need help getting dressed and undressed.I have to modify how I brush my teeth as I cannot lean over the sink to rinse. Driving is a chore, I cannot vacuum or do my household chores. Almost everything  I need to do is impacted due to the carelessness of this DR. And to top it all off Sleep is difficult  making life pretty miserable. I am a mom of 6 kids, and now cannot really do much to take care of them, they are having to help take care of me.\nAll they can say is \" here are a few free adjustments, and hope you get better .\"\n\nI don't think he intended to hurt me, but he did none the less, and I feel there should be a little more culpability when you hurt someone and screw up their life. I am having to go to my primary doctor so I can get something for the pain, and if any other treatments are needed I am stuck with that as well.\nDon't get sucked in by the cheap pay structure. If the adjustments don't feel right to you. Don't do it, or you may end up like me with your holidays ruined because of being hurt.", "business_id": "N-HP_fVMRbauRNz8cwhMog", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-11-25", "type": "review"}

And here is what makes her especially fantastic:\n\nOnce in awhile (NOT every time, mind you), she will call you up at home (after a procedure) to \"check up\" on you, and see that everything is OK.  For example, she might ask, \"Are you still having any pains?\"  or, \"Are you experiencing any discomfort from your visit with me?\"  She REALLY CARES!\n\nOn Friday, February 10, 2012, I needed to see her for an \"emergency\" procedure, due to a lower anterior tooth breaking, while I was having breakfast.  Fortunately, she happened to be open that particular Friday (she closes on Fridays, sometimes) and after explaining my situation, she ushered me right in.\n\nIt took her about a half hour to totally remove that troublesome tooth, because it had to be removed IN PIECES.  This, of course, was not her fault at all; it was just a bad tooth that rotted to the point where it had to removed little by little, and the root of the tooth was firmly \"anchored\" in my jawbone.\n\nBut, even though it took a long time to fully remove my tooth, I want everyone to know that the entire procedure was TOTALLY PAINLESS, and even though I experienced the feeling of pressure, the pressure wasn't painful or intolerable at all.\n\nI was warned by her that when the anesthetic from the procedure wore off, that the area of extraction might be \"tender\" and possibly painful, but, to my surprise, after the numbness was gone, I felt NO PAIN whatsoever, and the pain pills she prescribed for me, were not needed, nor utilized.\n\nWhen choosing a dental professional, you need to make certain that they have these two qualities: Gentleness and Honesty.\n\nDr. Pamela Caggiano has BOTH of them, and in great abundance.  I can assure you that if you visit her just one time, you will never wish to patronize anyone else.\n\nShe's THE BEST, and my dentist for life.", "business_id": "PPcGo-_qWus09qeMDcC-Dw", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-02-06", "type": "review"}

The front office employee, Dana simply ignored the situation while others in waiting area looked on in horror and some even asked Dana if \"there was someone who could  help the man on the floor\". Her response over and over was simply, \"Someone will be right with him\". After I took care of him and tried to make him more comfortable, I went and asked Dana if my Husband could go back and lie on an exam table as he was unable to sit. It was awful to see him  lying on the floor in so much pain in the waiting area! With much reluctance, she got up to ask someone if he could come back. So, after 55 minutes, my Husband was brought back and he was allowed to lie on exam table. We waited for 15 minutes for someone to come into room to check on him. I then spoke to someone in the back to let them know we had been waiting OVER an hour and my Husband was in extreme pain. Again, I was told, \"The doctor will be right with you\".  About 10 minutes later, a medical assistant popped her head in and said, \"The doctor will be with you soon\". When I tried to tell her how much pain my Husband was in, she ignored me and walked out of exam room. The Physician Assistant, Jie Ding came in about 12-15 minutes later, looking very annoyed and without looking at either one of us stated, \"What is all the moaning about?\" - his bedside manner was abhorrent and rude. After everything we experienced up to that point, along with the treatment we received from the PA, Ding, we opted to leave immediately and go to an Emergency Department. (We chose FastMed because an ED generally can be  busier with extremely long wait times along with higher co-pays.) Upon entering Scottsdale Healthcare Osborn ED, the nurse and aides moved quickly upon seeing the condition of my Husband and came out to assist him to a room. The physician immediately came in assessed the situation, ordered X-rays and gave my Husband medication to ease his pain until they were able to view the images and fully examine my Husband to make a proper diagnosis. The nurses and physician were efficient, caring, competent and knew how to address the needs of the patient. We received OUTSTANDING care at Scottsdale Healthcare Osborn. \nNEVER again will I ever step foot in a FastMed Urgent Care clinic!", "business_id": "GAA0q5EN3Brni89vD3pNHg", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-06-27", "type": "review"}

Originally it seemed like my provider Pat Washkowiak, RNP was very knowledgable and was very concerned for my well-being. She always had answers for my questions, especially why it was necessary for me to come back more frequently than I had thought necessary based on previous experience.   Unfortunately it turns out that she was basically using me to pad her bank account since I, as a self-pay patient was paying her out of pocket, in full at every visit.  I have found out that the \"care\" provided to me was against the guidelines she should have been following.\n\nThe front office, nursing and lab staff definitely left much to be desired.  The front office doesn't understand professionalism, always carrying on personal conversations loudly that are usually inappropriate.  When they do get around to check in they don't think twice about yelling personal information across the waiting room.  \n\nWhen I was unable to get specific answers from the nursing and billing staff regarding an appointment I spoke to the Office Manager regarding my frustrations and was told that neither are trained to understand why labs are ordered or trained to read the charted results to see why the provider is proceeding with a procedure etc.  That is more than a little scary to me.  If someone is going to be telling me that I need a procedure or be paying hundreds of dollars for a procedure I want them to be able to explain to me why.  I also found that I was given incorrect information regarding previous labwork that was done causing an additional bill of almost $200.  The office manager agreed to call LabCorp and negotiate a discount due to their error even after I advised that I would not be coming back to the clinic.  Apparently after speaking with Pat Washkowiak, NP it was decided not to honor that agreement, because LabCorp is still expecting payment in full.

I've never really been happy, but as I've been looking to leave the area, I hadn't pursued another doctor until now.  By far the biggest problem they have is their phone/support staff.\n\nI certainly don't expect CFP to diagnose me over the phone, but if I contact them for a follow up on an appointment I had, it's like pulling teeth to get a call back.  Calls typically take multiple business days to be returned - if they are at all.  This includes the time that I was in pain to the point I was spending 1/2 the day in bed.  Or the time I was traveling and forgot my prescription, and asked for a small quantity to be prescribed as I was 2000 miles away from the only bottle I had.  I've even called and spoken with management about not getting timely callbacks, but nothing has changed after months!\n\nTheir patient referral service isn't any better.  I've been called and \"told\" by their staff when my referred appointment was - without any input from me on what fits my schedule.  I've tried asking them for the name of the doctor so I can make my own appointment, only to be told they don't have that and only the referral person does.  Or the time I was in pain making it impossible to leave bed, and the only doctor they could refer me to didn't have any appointments for 1.5 months - and they had no other suggestions on where to go.  \n\nThe final straw was when I inquired about a preventive medicine for me.  The response I was given amounted to \"I've heard of that, but I don't know enough about it to be comfortable prescribing it.\"  There was no willingness for the doctor to research and follow up to me.  He couldn't even recommend a specialist who was familiar with it - and this wasn't an experimental treatment - this was a relatively new, but manufacturer-recognized use of a 10+ year old medicine.\n\nI don't think I've ever felt that CFP was customer-focused.  Rather, when I go there, I feel like I am viewed as a \"necessary evil\" for them to collect their money.

You all have a difficult job in caring for those that are dealing with some form of disability. With that, I do have a couple of criticisms which made you okay in my eyes.\n\n1.  My mother suffered not one but two falls while at our facility. This is of concern because even one fall is one too many. I did appreciate the phone call to let us know about it but we didn't know about the second one until my mother told me. She received a heck of a shiner out of it too.\n\n2.  My mother's circulation in her left arm and leg were poor and it took me to mention that concern. That's something that should be checked regularly to ensure she doesn't end up with potential bed sores. She did end up with one on an elbow. Yet again, it's the little things that count.\n\n3.  Why have a person that obviously is suffering from some form of back pain work with patients when it requires lifting. I watched a person come in with very little enthusiasm to help my mother get back to bed and then she almost pulled the catheter out of my mom when she was moving her wheelchair away. It took me yelling at her to get her attention. Once again, little things count.\n\nI will say that Jaynie was very informative and helpful with placing my mother at her next facility. I think she seemed a little bothered by others asking for information on my mother but she called about that and we made those arrangements.\n\nThis place is an acute care facility and considered a hospital, so don't expect for someone to stay for a long time.

She rocks! Very highly quialified and professional. She is even certified in a dry needling technique which looks similar to acupuncture, which someday I might be giving a try, but at the moment I personally cannot fathom any pointy objects anywhere near my hypersensitive rib area, but maybe it's for you, and I have heard she produces amazing results, and instantaneous healing.\nUpdate: I totally had Dry Needling done by the amazing Krystle Alexander and she was absolutely stellar at it! The first few, I didn't even know she put them in, and I was extremely nervous and anxiety was flooding through me, but she put me at ease, and her intensely skilled hands did a superb job! I made it through almost 60 needles in my back! That is a huge accomplishment for me and it would not have been possible without Krystle doing such an outstanding job!\nI also have had the pleasure of working with the ultra-knowledgable \"Bill\"/William, and he REALLY knows what he is doing! I think I remember learning that he used to own his own practice at one time, and jokes he has been doing this for like 100 years, but he is totally a young spirit, with wise and skillfully professional hands! Thanks for all your help and expertise, Bill!\nThe CORE Institute was a great experience for physical therapy, and I would definitely recommend you give them a try if your body is in need of some rehabilitation!", "business_id": "fVPxoPH4uILVaz0iZAwxHw", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-04-18", "type": "review"}

Nice!  My wife joined, and she got the relief that she was looking for.  A few follow-up appointments later, and the pain was gone.\n\nKeep in mind--this is stripped-down chiro service.  There's no x-rays or initial consultations, no water jet beds or IR lasers.  If you're looking for just straight up chiropractic with no commitments, this may be the Joint you're looking for.

I am ok with a small stuffy waiting room that is close and crowded with chairs with metal arms... so close that you have to rub elbows with other people waiting...but the staff members sit maybe 5 feet from you and were consistently rude - and they lack patient commitment of time effort and appreciation for their patients... I am a teacher and asked for an appointment in mid JUNE...there was nothing available for me through the ENTIRE summer - so they scheduled me in OCTOBER! I would say the attendant was almost gleeful that she could not find me an appointment for that long...she said I should call 6 months in advance from now on.   As the appointment time neared they sent me a really poorly written  text reminder three weeks before the appointment - so I called them asking about it and the office woman was offended at me because I did not press C to confirm - and I said the text did not say that - but she was not interested in hearing me - she even acted like I was silly not to know that  - I tried to change the appointment because something had come up at school and she was very condescending...muttering about teachers and all their demands.. I informed her that I wasn't sure I could make it...she informed me that on Nevada day HER doctor was going to take the day off and take his children trick or treating, and said it in a way that indicated I was a horrible patient to prevent a man from being with his children. That poor doctor...if he only knew that his staff was giving away his personal information and information regarding what he is doing with his children.  I do not know the doctor personally in any way and think that for the sake of his family that his activities with his children should not be part of the conversation.  I had not demanded, only asked, because we had the day off..

For all the money we pay for dental care a decent waiting room with clean chairs would be a plus too. - I do emphasize it is only the office help - the dental staff did a good job once you got through the door..

That dentist also confirmed the truth - 8 cavities and a possible root canal if the prior cavity filled was too deep to fix. Not only did they show me the x-rays but also the photos of the black holes and pits.  Several had been there for more than 6 months and probably more than a year. And I go to the dentist every 6 months - I like my teeth clean and that awesome feeling that there are no icky cavities. \n\nJust an FYI - Dr. Walker said I had stains on my teeth and they were definitely not stains.

I was so tired of traditional counselors, and telling them the same old story without improvement. It's tiring when you tell the same story and nothing changes. I found Becky on the Thumbtack website. I had a good feeling about her, especially the fact she was willing to work with my financial needs-this is always a good sign.\nMy first consultation with her- no hypnotherapy- I actually felt better. I felt like finally I was on the right track to handling my past traumas and current situation. She told me she would get me off my anxiety meds in that first counsultation. Lo and behold after only a consultation I felt no neeed to take them anymore.\nI purchased five sessions with Becky after the consultation because I was confident she was able to help me put some of my demons at rest. And she did that and more. I felt comfortable with her because she is a very real, nice, honest and funny person. She made me feel at ease immediately. She validated my feelings and gave me a new perspective on self defeating thoughts and thinking.\nHypnotherapy for me was not being hypnotized and not knowing what the heck I was doing or saying. I was aware, in a guided relaxed state, with positive thoughts entering my mind. My favorite was the last session where I did a bit of past life regression. Becky will not make you go through a negative experience, in fact she takes you out of it almost immediately, unless she has questions about the event.\nThe other thing I love about Becky is that she is always in contact with her patients. She texts and emails which to me is fabulous. Don't be surprised if you get a text out of the blue or an email to find out how you are doing. Even if the sessions are up she still wants to know how you are doing.\nThis is a fabulous woman, teacher and friend. I can't imagine saying anything bad about her. She truly understands and knows what she is doing. I love her and plan to get periodic sessions from her. I also will listen to whatever she tells me to do to help in my self healing process. She is truly such an inspiring person.\n-On another note, if you do not know where your life is going or where you should be, she will tell you.

It definitely gets crowded at that time, so if you can make it here during off-hours, it is a decent gym. Very clean and nice locker rooms.  Plus, I once lost a necklace here, and the cleaning staff found it and gave it back to me, so props for that.\n\nI do have some serious issues with this gym, though. I am a group exerciser, so my main problem is with the group exercise facilities, which seem to have just been thrown together without much thought. Most of the classes are just randomly held in one part of the gym that is separated from the rest of the gym by sheer netting. As a result, when you're exercising the entire gym can (and usually does) stare at you. There also isn't a mirror anywhere for you to check your form. The YMCA actually has a proper group exercise room hidden away in another part of the building where a few classes are held, but it isn't clearly marked at all, plus you have get a special pass from the front desk to even get to it--very inconvenient.  The spin classes are held in the middle of the running track , so while you are spinning, joggers, often engaged in loud conversation, are constantly running by you, which is pretty annoying.  In general, the classes taught here tend to be different than at other YMCAs--the instructors are older and the classes are very Jane Fonda-esque.  I've been to a lot of them and have found the spin classes and the Body Pump (group weightlifting) classes to be the most challenging and have the best instruction. I've never been to the Athletic Conditioning class, but it seems pretty intense, too.  That said, in general, I don't think the classes are as hard as what you find at the Dowd or the Gateway (the Turbokick classes here are in no way as good as the ones at Gateway and the Dowd YMCAs).\n\nThis gym does have great pool going for it.

Great price, very friendly staff.  Experienced several occasions of trying to call in and spending a considerable amount of time on hold, a few times being disconnected and having to go back into the Que. for an additional lengthy hold.  I've worked for a doctor's office before, and I know that phones can be overwhelming and this office offers a LOT of services, and therefor a LOT of patients, also they close at noon on Fridays, and if you try to call any later than 11:30am, good luck reaching anyone.\n\nMy first 3 treatments on all 4 areas produced NO results.  I've had family members have these procedures done and I know my hair is darker than theirs, although not super dark for any of us.  Their treatments (from different providers) were completely successful within 1 or 2 treatments.  I mentioned that I didn't feel like I was seeing results, and was just told my hair was too light in pigment, no offer for solution.  \n\nThe aesthetician that did the majority of my treatments (Tisha, mentioned in several previous posts) was no longer employed there for what would be my 4th treatment, so the office manager, Sharon, took over.  She made me feel very comfortable and definitely knows what she's talking about.  I mentioned to her as well that it didn't seem to be effective for me.  She, unlike Tisha, offered to raise the energy level of the laser and for the first time I saw some results.\n\nNow, up to this point I'd say they had certainly earned a 3 star rating, possibly 4 star based on their recovery of issues that came up along the way.  \n\nHOWEVER-\n\nDue to some truly alarming shoddy medical record keeping, the office somehow managed to document that I had been there and received 3 treatments in total that I DID NOT RECEIVE.  Even when talking with the office manager, and explaining that they had documented dates for cancelled appointments and recorded them as having treatments received (several documented treatments being only 1-2 weeks apart due to a schedule and reschedule) and knowing that all the treatments were recommended to be scheduled 4-6 weeks apart, they made no attempt to reconcile their record keeping errors.\n\nSo it's a GOOD thing I got a ridiculously low price for these treatments.\n\nMy suggestion: keep impeccable records on your own for when you've been in for actual appointments, and check back regularly if you've ever needed to reschedule to make sure their MEDICAL RECORDS are accountable and accurate.\n\nCompletely absurd that an office that handles actual medical patients, not just cosmetic procedures, could have such sloppy record keeping habits.\n\nBEWARE.", "business_id": "037Nr9p0OiWrC467S9u9eg", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-09-12", "type": "review"}

On the day after New Year's, my husband woke up extremely ill, with a 102 fever, nausea and low back pain. Our internist's office had no openings available, thanks to the already-raging flu season, so again we called on Advantage Urgent Care for help. We logged on to the website, input his info, and within 10 minutes got a call telling us to come in immediately. Adding to the stress was the fact that my husband's employer changed their medical insurance with the new year, and we had yet to receive his new insurance card. All we had was some partial info I printed off the insurance company website and I was worried they wouldn't accept it. Fortunately the girl at the front desk assured me it was not a problem. Given that we received an EOB from the insurance company 3 weeks later, I guess it wasn't! :)\n\nBack to my hubby's care...less than an hour after we arrived, we were on our way out with a kidney infection diagnosis and prescription for antibiotics in hand. The doctor he saw told him that if he was not considerably better within 48 hours, or got worse before that, he should go to the ER to be checked for kidney stones (yikes!) They also sent his specimen out to be cultured at a lab. Fortunately, 48 hours later he was doing considerably better. \n\nWhat impressed me most, however, is that the doctor from Advantage actually called us three days after he saw my husband, to give him the results of his lab culture (diagnosis confirmed) and to make sure that he was indeed feeling better and did not need further care. We have never, ever had that kind of follow-up from an Urgent Care clinic before, so props to Advantage Urgent Care for going that extra mile, it is appreciated!", "business_id": "r3DcOncukt-julF6u0xS1w", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-05-26", "type": "review"}

I visited this location after being sick for nearly 5 weeks. I was losing my voice constantly and couldn't stop coughing, so hard that I had pulled muscles in my back. Upon first glance, everything looked great. The office is spotless, and the receptionists are very kind. The wait was not long at all, and the woman who took all my vitals was wonderful. You could tell she enjoyed her job and liked being there. Then, they put me in an exam room, and I waited.\n\nThe young man who came in to check out my concerns was a PA. He asked me some questions about how I was feeling and I had to explain probably six or seven times while he checked me out. He kept asking me the same questions over and over again. It started making me feel like he was doubting me. I told him I had taken some OTC meds a couple weeks before and they didn't help after a week, so I stopped. He said asked if I would like to do a strep test. I said if he thought it would rule anything out, then yes please. He asked me a couple more times and I said please, let's do it, you seem to think it's important. He then told me, \"well, I know you don't have strep, but let's do it anyway.\" \n\nAfter waiting for 20 more minutes they did the test and yes, it was negative. He started asking me the same questions all over again. I had no voice, was having issues talking, and had to cough after every couple of words. He tells me, \"well, I don't see anything wrong with you.\" Um, excuse me?\n\nHe ended up prescribing me three medications \"just in case\" - some antibiotics (because there was \"no way\" I was sick but \"let's cover our bases\"), another pill to help with the coughing (it didn't) and another OTC medication to help with the congestion I did not have. $200 later, I am still sick, going on 8 weeks now.\n\nI understand that some people do not present with illness the same way as others, and I also understand that this gentleman was doing his job. But the way he was speaking to me was so unacceptable. He made me feel as though I was lying about being ill, and that I was there trying to get prescriptions for no reason. I would have much rather not spent $65 on medications that didn't work but after feeling terrible for so long I was willing to try anything. I was actually quite offended by the way I was treated.

A lot of them mentioned SCP (both the Shea and Osborn locations).  I gave them a call and let them know I was still pregnant, but was looking for a ped for my son when he arrived.  I had questions - they happily answered!  I had a feeling this was going to be a good match.\n\nSo fast forward to Baby C's birth.  I knew from the moment I learned I was pregnant that I wanted to breastfeed.  Our first official day at the birthing suites, in the couplet rooms, on the night shift..I had a nurse from HELL.  From manhandling me and Baby C, to belittling my efforts and pushing formula.  At 6am, I snapped.  I literally lost my shit and went a little nuts, crying hysterically and hyperventilating after the Demon Nurse did her final check on us and got her last rude comment in before she left.  Dr. Garrett walked in a minute later.  She calmed me down, told me that my body knew what to do (and I needed to trust that and myself), and then proceeded to go report the nurse to the nursing supervisor.  From that moment - I knew Dr. Garrett had not only Baby C's best interest but mine (and my parenting plan/wishes) as well.  A match made in baby heaven!\n\nNow, unfortunately Baby C suffers from a few respiratory ailments.  The handful of times I've taken him in, Dr. Garrett is pleased with how my treatment has gone thus far (giving breathing treatments, etc) and she basically trusts my judgment (i have my own resp issues, so I know the drill).  Baby C has dodged the hospital admission bullet a few times - because we can get a handle on his breathing and she knows that I'm on the ball with his treatment.  But she knows that if I bring him in to be seen, there's a problem.  \n\nOH - She's also not one of those Drs that will just throw antibiotics at the problem.  Not if antibiotics aren't truly warranted.  She in fact isn't the kinda Dr to prescribe meds just to appease the patients parents.  I know a few parents like that...demanding antibiotics for a basic virus that antibiotics wont do squat for (but help with the problem of antibiotic resistant super-bugs).   \n\nOh and the office staff - from the front desk to the nurses are wonderful too!.

They tried to make us pay for our newborn's charges which were different from the mother's charges. Newborn babies are not yet on insurance plans. And since they are not yet on your insurance, the charges are very high as you could imagine. We were not required to pay them before leaving the hospital but they certainly pressured us into paying. We went home and put our baby on our insurance plan which reduced the charges by 2/3. \n\n(5) Discharge was significantly delayed.  An ultrasound and hearing screen was ordered the previous day in the morning. They didn't do the ultrasound and hearing screen until the following day in the afternoon. These are routine tests that are usually done a few hours after they are ordered. Instead of going home that morning, we didn't leave until 4 PM. What contributed to the delay was a Resident failing to leave a prescription that our doctor ordered.", "business_id": "CAD0tKIttOTTgT7TMJa-lQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-09-24", "type": "review"}

I later found out my colleague has been O'Sullivan's patient for several years. \nWait times: Morning appts are the best- I've never waited more that five minutes for a morning appt. Late afternoon appts on Fridays never start on time and it is common to wait 20-50 minutes for the appointment to begin. I prefer later appts so I just plan ahead and use the time to catch up on emails, watch the baby kick, and chat with my spouse. \nFront Office: Katie at the front desk is irreplaceable. I don't know her title or position, but I assume she is the manager because she incredible professional, she makes it her goal to know the patients and spouses by name, she uses the patient's time wisely when scheduling future appts, and she does everything with a smile! The other women at the front desk are never friendly and seem to be put-out when I ask a question on the phone or face to face. They answer the question, but I think they prefer to be uninterrupted. \nDoctor: Erin O'Sullivan is my prenatal doctor and Kathy is her medical assistant. Kathy is a perfect partner to O'Sullivan. She is sweet and excitable and loves hearing pregnancy updates. I enjoy our quick encounters because she is caring. O'Sullivan is awesome. She is not sweet or giggly, but that isn't her job. She is professional, dedicated, and passionate about her career. She is overtly honest with her answers and rarely sugar-coats. She supports natural childbirth and alternative birthing options and will give her professional opinion using years of experiences from the hospital and midwife/physician community meetings. She doesn't give an answer to a question in hopes that you like her answer; she provides you the response she thinks is best. I will continue to visit O'Sullivan for my annual exams and future prenatal exams because although she is not sweet, I know she is passionate and dedicated to the well being of her patients. \nUnexpected Situations: Once, I called the office at 6AM on a Saturday because I was concerned about symptoms I was experiencing. I left a message with the after-hours rep and Dr. O'Sullivan returned my call within about 30 seconds. She answered my concerns, made suggestions, and did not rush off the phone. I could tell that I woke her just because her voice was different, but she did not seem put-out at all. She has told me in the past that she chose a 24 hour career and she embraces it. \nOverall, I strongly recommend this office. Staff come and go so I don't worry about the two I've encountered who aren't customer-service oriented. Katie at the front should be your go-to person so try avoiding the others if you have questions and don't want to have a negative experience. \nKathy and Dr. O'Sullivan are great! I've also met with two nurses, Bergdale and another- once during a last minute scheduled appt (I was experiencing uncommon bleeding in second trimester and O'Sullivan was at the hospital] and once during a routine visit [I rescheduled at the last minute]. No complaints from either appt. The medical team is incredible.", "business_id": "nEaJwY77drRqQkJqcd9LRg", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-07-13", "type": "review"}

The hygienists and receptionists are a fantastic staff but I find Dr. Jenista to be consistently half-assed and unfriendly.

This afternoon was the last straw: He was following up on a concern I had about my tooth the last time I was in there and while discussing it with me he was very condescending and made me feel like an idiot for even bringing it up. I didn't realize being concerned about a possible tooth issue was not appropriate to discuss with my dentist! Lesson learned. After that ordeal he proceeded to bad-mouth another patient to the receptionist which I find to be extremely unprofessional to do when anyone other than staff is present. There have been other issues but I won't rant about it here. The main point to take from this is that while he may offer several options, the personal touch is just not there and I have never walked out of there feeling like a valued patient (not to mention- my entire family has also decided to look for another dentist for the same reasons). \n\nI want to point out, though, that the rest of the staff is very pleasant and are a joy to be around so- aside from dealing with Dr. Jenista you will be treated well.", "business_id": "t9fDDws6uSEnAm0eupcLrQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-07-19", "type": "review"}

I am an executive for a large health care provider.  My insurance changed so I had to find a new eye doctor. I simply chose AES because of the location to my work. When I initially called the appointment line, before I was asked my name, I was asked for my DOB.  The day of my appointment, I called to verify I was going to the correct address, again the first question I was asked was, what's your DOB?  My response was I do have a first name you know and then I gave her my first name and then DOB.  Of course she said that is how the system is set up to verify a patient.  I showed up at the office, 3rd street and Osborn.  I was not greeted by Stephanie, she only barked orders to me. There was no hi, hello, can I help you?  I walked up, said my name and I had an appointment.  Her first words were, \"I need your ID and insurance card.\"  Wow, really was my reaction?  I proceeded to give her the demanded items.  The next words were, \"I need you to fill these out and bring them back to me while handing me the insurance paper work.\"  At that point, I almost just walked out because this is not a place I am going to do business with.  But, I filled out the paper work and when I went to give them back, I said here you go.  She was too busy having a conversation with a co worker she did not acknowledge me.  I said again, here you go.  She gave me a dirty look with an expression of disgust and if saying, I heard you the first time.  The never said a word and not even a thank you.  I posted my review on Yelp, I have made a complaint to my insurance company as well.  I will not be back to this location.

At 9:15 I considered leaving the exam room, asking for a refund and going across the street to Urgent Care, which I have experienced is much quicker. Instead I just opened my door and watched the nothingness happening outside of my room. I'll go with a pros and cons on this review:\nPros: I was checked in the moment I walked in. Love It Or List It (a popular show on HGTV) was playing in the waiting room, which also had ample seating. They took my insurance and copayment within a few minutes of being checked in.\nCons: There were no computers in the exam rooms, the nurse wrote down all of my vitals and information. I was not asked ONCE if I had an allergy to medication (I do). When I went to check out there were two staff members walking around behind the counter, not even acknowledging me for a full two minutes. I was given a prescription instead of them sending it to my preferred pharmacy for pick up.\nIf you have to go here over UPMC Urgent Care because of insurance or cost, it will be fine.

I've been suffering from chronic shoulder pain ever since I was in a car accident a little over two years ago. I had been seeing another chiro for a while, but he didn't really seem to hear me when I said how much it bothered me. Of course, every doctor has their specialty and not every chiropractor focuses on soft tissue issues. Dr. Bennett does. Which, I think makes total sense. Even if you get an adjustment, how can you truly benefit from it if you don't work along with the muscles and connective tissue surrounding the bones to get them to support your adjustment? You'll just end up slipping right back out of place as soon as you walk out the office. \n\nSo, that's what I love about this doctor. She truly has a 'holistic' approach in my opinion. Not only are her adjustments gentle and effective, she has really helped both my husband and I with our soft tissue issues. I now, after only 4 treatments, have much more fluidity and mobility in my shoulder (even my pilates teacher noticed a difference!) I no longer have to stop in mid-work out because of shooting pain. Now, don't get me wrong...the actual treatment can be rather painful (especially if you have had an injury) but the expression  \"no pain, no gain\" is espcially applicable in this case. You may not walk out feeling super great, and you may need to ice, however, you will definitly see a long term improvment, after only a few treatments. Dr. Bennett has definitly improved the quality of our lives. Thank you Dr. B!", "business_id": "HxzCCUBQDCM2CaHOT-yUew", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-06-05", "type": "review"}

My faith in this place has kind of faltered. It's not the worst, they're clean, and they're professional. They don't have a high rate of dentists coming and going and they did a pretty good job on my mouth and my surgery.\n\nSo why am I dropping it? It's a little long, but bear with me because it's pretty legit.\n\nI got an infection shortly after having it; this isn't their fault, but I was out of town. I initially called them about setting up a return appointment just to check on things and the receptionist said, \"Oh! You don't need to come back unless you're in pain!\"--which, I thought was kind of weird because after most surgeries (I've never had one myself, but I'm going on family and friends' histories here), your health provider would like to see you in case something DOES go wrong. Here's detraction reason #1.\n\nAnd it sort of, in a minor way, did. As I said, I was out of town. I went to a surgeon in Cedar Rapids, IA who gave me a check up and noticed the minor infection. When they got my file from this place, they noticed that I was prescribed Amoxicillin.\n\nExcept, I never got it. My dad was given all my pharmaceutical prescriptions shortly after leaving and Amoxicillin was not on that list of ones given to us. I had to explain to the Cedar Rapids dental surgeon that no, I never received it, so I'd have to be put on Clindamyacin. That went off without a hitch, fortunately, but if you prescribe someone something like an antibiotic and they don't have it? That's a little side-eye worthy right there. They also told me it was kind of weird that they didn't have a scheduled appointment to see me after the surgery. Ugh. Detraction reason #2 and #3.\n\nI came back because the pain in my jaw didn't go away. It wasn't a dry socket, per se--just in the jawline. When I came back to visit, the dentist had kind of an air of \"Ugh, you again?\" and kind of seemed dismissive. I dunno. I'm probably being too sensitive, but that was the feeling I got. Detraction reason #4. I just got my clove strip, went home, came back two days later and had it out.\n\nI still think these guys are pretty good and definitely ought to be considered if you're having dental surgery, I just got rubbed the wrong way with some of the run-around.", "business_id": "QJI-AfNpU3d4QOdUg7MY7A", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-01-21", "type": "review"}

She cleaned my teeth and when she was almost done, somehow the powder they use to polish your teeth, went ALL OVER ME.  All over my face, the chair, my neck, everywhere!

The bathroom is right around the corner.\" OMG! After i got cleaned up (luckily I didn't have to go to work!), she didn't finish or floss my teeth like they are supposed to.. just handed me a bag with a toothbrush and floss, and sent me to the front. The receptionist also wasn't very friendly either.. when I asked her to explain the charges again for the \"restoration procedure\" I had done, and I said what I thought she told me prior to the procedure, she snapped back and said, \"That's NOT what I said.\" OKay...... how rude! I never received an apology from the hygenist and the receptionist was the icing on the cake.  I will never go back, it's sad because the actual dentist was a really sweet doctor and she was very attentive.  Her staff, on the other hand, really needs an attitude adjustment.

I also had a surgery here this past Friday and I was very well cared for by all. I was treated with great respect and had outstanding customer service from the Nurse Anesthesiologist Justin. Justin really listened to my concerns and solved any issues that could arise from side effects. He was also very kind and friendly. He could sense I was a bit scared and was a calming soul. I had a prior bad experience with surgery Anesthesia so was very nervous. I credit Justin with almost no side effects from this round of Anesthesia. Diane in PreOp and Agnes (I think that was her name) were also very caring souls. I just adore nurses.  \n\nThe one and only bit of advice I could give is that the Recovery Room stay should be longer in my opinion. I am not sure why they kick you out so fast. Wave of the times I suppose. It did not seem that busy but maybe they needed the bed. That worries me a bit since I had challenges getting home. I think it would have been better to let me stay a few more hours. They literally had me dressed and out the door in about 40 minutes after surgery. The Recovery Room nurse was a bit gruff.

The voucher was for an hour foot reflexology & massage with salt scrub. I thought it was all going to take place on my feet...but was completely wrong.

The gigantic chaise lounge that is actually a massage table, was so comfortable that I swore to myself I would have one in my home one day.

But when something works, why mess with it?\n\nI have been going to Moga for about a year now and my results have been nothing short of phenomenal.  In my head, I'd like to believe that I'm some super athlete that requires yoga to perform at peak levels.  More realistically, I'm an average Joe that works out a couple times a week & runs a couple times a week.  Moga is a welcome break from your every day workout \"blahs\".  I also believe it works as an adjunct to my physical fitness, allowing me to perform better and recuperate faster.  I truly look forward to every session with them.\n\nThe studio is situated in a cute little corner of SouthEnd (Atherton Mills).  There is plenty of natural light brought in by the huge windows on the second story.  You're always greeted with a warm, kind smile by whoever is working that session.  They check you in and usher you upstairs.\n\nThere is plenty of room and equipment (foam blocks, blankets, stretch straps, extra yoga mats).  I assume they do this intentionally but the class size is never too big.  I always feel like the instructor has time during the class to better position me in certain poses.  The atmosphere is always relaxed, soft, & welcoming.  They have plenty of class times, so getting in never seems to be an issue.\n\nThe sessions vary in time (I usual go to the 60 min class).  Fun, contemporary music is played.  Things are kept light and people have fun.  The voices are calming.  Everybody is smiling.  When class is over you're given a shot of coconut water, which is a really nice touch.\n\nFinally, I have to comment on the staff/ownership.  Beth & Emily (Breeze) do a amazing job.  They are highly organized.  They are welcoming, never intimidating.  Their company's tremendous growth over the past year is a testament to their business plan and their \"moral compass\" as teachers.  Their staff is top notch.  Their facilities are great.  Their customer service is second to none.\n\nIf you're nervous or intimidated by trying yoga, STOP.  Pick up the phone or visit the Moga website.  You won't be disappointed.", "business_id": "Yna7Av8pN0g2kPua7pM9qQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-04-22", "type": "review"}

Dr. Schwartz indicated to me that in his judgment, based on my test results, I was not a good candidate for regular LASIK, but was one for the newer (and more expensive) intra-LASIK procedure.\n\nA few days after my consult, after determining that I could afford it, I elected to have the procedure done there. In advance of it I got three sets of prescription eyedrops, which ran me about $400 -- definitely expensive, but in the context of having my eyes fixed, and properly, isn't prohibitive in my opinion.\n\nMy appointment was for 2:00. I filled out some paperwork (the informed consent forms, etc), and was taken to a back room near the operating room, where I was given a series of eye drops and verbally given some instructions for what to do after the procedure (when to take drops, go home and sleep, etc). At this point they called my driver, saying I would be finished in about 15 minutes. \n\nThen they called me into the operating room, where you are laid down on the table. Dr. Schwartz and his assistants verbally confirm your identity and the procedure they will be performing on you. My entire procedure took, by my estimation, about 4 minutes. It was a little jarring, and it wasn't easy to concentrate on the blinking light given that my corneal flap was pulled back, but, everything went completely fine.\n\nAfter it was over they walked me out of the room; my vision was slightly blurry, like I was underwater, and there was a strong foreign-object sensation in both eyes. I took two Tylenol PMs I had brought with me, and was walked out to my driver. Went home, slept, and woke up with 20/15 vision. The first follow-up visit was the next morning, where they had me read the lines on the chart like any normal eye appointment. \n\nAfter two decades of blurred, miserable vision, I really haven't got words to describe how wonderful this is, being able to see better than perfectly. \n\nI am taking the prescribed medication, and having no discernible side-effects or complications. My last follow-up is on Friday.\n\nI'm supremely pleased with the entire experience there, and would definitely recommend this place to anyone considering LASIK.", "business_id": "BLHR4o5R4uTuRV0uY-COjg", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-06-20", "type": "review"}

The first time I went here was for dizzying spells, and double vision in which they determined they could not do anything for me but to refer me to the emergency room. The PA was not the most friendliest person and in fact the only overtly friendly person there was the receptionist. \n\nThis most recent time I went because I needed an emergency script and I could not get into my regular doctor on time. The receptionist was friendly as usual and the PA was a little more friendly but the overall staff needs more work. Never go to an urgent care if you require more care beyond a headache or cold symptoms.

It was not until Dr Gary Core took digital images and told me of the dangerous situation of bacteria in the same area underneath that was working its way towards the nerve and about the disintegration of my jaw bone because of it.  Immediately Dr Core got me on an antibiotic for a few days.  The time it took to remove the problem tooth and build up the bone underneath, then sew up my gums was fast, maybe ten minutes, it took about as long to sedate the area.  Dr Core explained everything, he asked a lot of questions that other dentist didn't think to ask.  Weeks later I came across a story of a young man with a toothache who did not get treatment for the same kind of bacterial infection.  It put him in the hospital where he did not make it overnight.

I asked the reception if I could have a tour  or look around and the head Trainer happened to be near me. He grabbed me and eagerly said sure. So after we chatted and looked at the training areas, he explained to me that I had to make an appointment with the Sales guy and I did conveniently for the following day.\n\nThe appointment with the sales guy was shorter then usual b/c I had already seen most of the facility the day before. I enjoyed talking with him, at first it was like a lifestyle interview and I told him why I was there. I was very impressed with the whole place. The women's dressing room is not smelly. There are fresheners everywhere. The showers, when I am there, are very clean. There's not even hair caught in the drain, which is something I can barely tolerate. \n\n98% of the time I get the exact cardio machine I want. There are TV's with cable connected to most of the machines, requiring you to just plug in your earphones and you can watch TV while you workout. My one irk :: these TV's do not always work and this is annoying. \n\nI am there 4 times a week for about 1.5 hours each visit. It IS very expensive, I pay a permanent $86 and some cents / month for my membership - my rate will never go up.

I haven't quite completed all of the 6 treatments I purchased, but I have enough experience with the place that I can now review it.\n\nFor starters, they use the type of laser machine that never touches your skin, which is a BIG plus for me.  My friend got laser treatments at a different place with a type of machine that touches your skin and she actually caught a skin virus from it, yuck.\n\nSecondly, I've always had positive, friendly interactions with the ladies who work there - from the receptionists to the technicians.\n\nThird, they are very careful to not use the laser on you if you've recently been exposed to sun and they warn you not to go into the sun after treatment.  This prevents any adverse reaction or hyperpigmentation.  And the sun seriously does affect you afterwards!  Just walking from the place to my car and I could feel my legs start burning from the sun exposure.\n\nMost importantly - the laser treatments really work!  After my 3rd treatment I started to notice a significant decrease in hair.  And I could go a lot longer between days when I had to shave my legs.  The only thing to note is that when you buy a Groupon, it will typically include 6 treatments.  And for most people that's not enough.  I expect that I will need 8 treatments to have completely smooth legs.  And those treatments without a Groupon are pricey!  Even with their \"special deal\" they gave me, it still ended up being $200/session for the extra sessions I need.\n\n*one \"trick\" I just thought of is that maybe you can buy a Groupon for the Scottsdale location and then buy a Groupon for the Biltmore location?  it might work... keep it in mind...\n\nthe only cons that I will note are that sometimes they are busy and running behind.  I've had to wait up to 40 min for my appt before.  also, sometimes the technicians are rushed, so it seems like they aren't as thorough with the laser as at other times.  for example, they are supposed to mark your leg into quadarants with chalk to help keep track of which sections have been lasered and which haven't.  well, sometimes when they are in a rush they don't bother to do that and I feel like they maybe miss spots.\n\noh and as for the pain, it's very little (at least for me).  on a scale of 1-10, most of the time it feels like a 1, but for some particular areas (like around the ankles) it can feel up to a 3.  but that does not last long.\n\nI would recommend this place, esp. w/ a Groupon!  do it, you won't regret it.", "business_id": "GcSxqe1qz9UuIrtd3lZllQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-01-06", "type": "review"}

Noting this, we went to BDP for a free consultation expecting the best. What we got was the worst. \nMaking the appt was easy and the people on the phone were pleasant. However, when we got into the office, they acted like we couldn't afford the procedure and therefore weren't worth the time. They didn't explain any of the tests they did, nor did they talk to my husband the entire 2 hours he was there. When my husband tried to ask questions, he was ignored. When the doctor saw him, it wasn't any better. He was brief and to the point. My husband required PRK LASIK and it would be about $4000. When my husband tried to ask a question or inquire about the vision for life program, he was told quickly about the medications he would need to purchase in addition to the procedure. The doctor then promptly closed his folder and left. \nIn contrast to this, we visited another LASIK doctor with good ratings and were treated like we were worth his time, explained everything to, and talked to thoroughly about the procedure and medications. They never once left us in the dark, nor did they treat us substandard. The price was the same as BDP, the difference was in how we were treated.

We will be moving out of state this summer and I hope that we are able to find a good doctor like Dr. Nishihara.....I have hope since he's given me a few name's of doctor's in the state we are moving to plus he used to live there and practiced medicine there. \nWhen I first started to take my daughter to him I asked him a question and his first response to me was like I was dumb and should know the answer, well you don't know everything when it's your first child. I've ready other reviews on other site's that say Dr. Nishihara is rude, arrogant and condescending. I can agree with that to some degree, but the man knows his stuff and he's great with my daughter. I want to take my daughter someplace where the doctor knows his stuff and is there for his patients not there just for a paycheck and doesn't care about the kids. \nI was out of state our first winter in Vegas and my daughter had been sick with a cough, I called the office on a weekend and left a message with the phone service and within 15 minute's the doctor had called me back. Another time my daughter was sick he even called me the next evening to make sure she was feeling better. What doctor's these day's do house calls?!?! \nI've never had an issue getting an appointment and when we get to the office we've only had to wait a couple of minute's at most twice. The office is clean. Each exam room has it's own theme. The doctor is very clean, he washes his hand's when he comes into the room and after he does something, even wipes the cord's down. \nJennifer and Mo nae are his main nurse's and they're great as well. Dr. Nishihara might be a training doctor because there have been a couple time's that there's new people in along with the usual. \nI'm going to miss Dr. Nishihara and his staff when we move but will gladly refer him.", "business_id": "LUhVfCMmLaiKKGvXTVc20A", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-01-20", "type": "review"}

My first appointment was cordial and professional. He explained all the intricacies of the \"procedure\" and what to expect after the fact. I felt very comfortable speaking with him. Unlike most doctors I deal with on a daily basis, he spent a significant amount of time answering my questions and just simply going over everything. i was set to go for my \"procedure\" a month later!\n\nFor the procedure, I was sent to one of the office suites right on time. I was nervous of course. And initially, Dr. Darson's prep assistant made me extremely uncomfortable. he didn't say a word. when i asked what i should do, he just said \"strip from the waist down and wait\". came in a few seconds later, still no sound except \"sit on the table\". then as i'm laying back, he keeps running into my feet as he rushes around the room. it didn't make me any more comfortable. so i'm laying there with all my manhood just exposed and rethinking my decision. \n\nas the procedure began, he warmed up. i guess he was waiting for me to talk to him, so i started asking him about his kids, his job, sports, etc. It was a lot more relaxed after that. but what set the bar was Dr. Darson. He made me feel completely at ease. he talked to me throughout like a person, not a patient. not many doctors do that (as i'm sure most of you know). he explained step by step what he was doing, interjected with social questions about my day, my life, just stuff. it was really reassuring. \n\n20 minutes later and i was all done. that's it! a few follow-ups in the weeks to come, and i'll be good to go. plan ahead though. you are advised not to work or lift heavy objects or strenuous exercise for 7-10 days, so plan accordingly. overall, highly recommended doctor and procedure.....just be sure you don't ever, ever, ever want any/more babies!!!! his procedure is pretty darn permanent!", "business_id": "IvfZ7cz1ZH_ziAf6WkyEmQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-03-08", "type": "review"}

I am still waiting to receive the glasses that I paid for.  I paid on 5-3-13 and then waited.  After waiting two weeks I called to see when my glasses would be ready and was put on hold.  I was on hold forever when I was finally told that the factory had made an error with my prescription and that they had to be sent back.  I was told that they would rush the service and call me as soon as the glasses were ready.  I waited a week and called to see when the glasses would be ready and was told they just arrived.  I went in and picked them up.  I wore the glasses for two days when a friend informed me that the glasses were not darkening in the sun.  He showed me how the lenses did not change at all in the direct sun light.  I took the glasses back and the representative tried to convince me that the lenses were exactly what I had ordered.  When I asked her to step outside in the sunlight and show me she suddenly decided that maybe all I had was the anti-glare and the lenses were not correct.  She said she would correct the glasses and would do a rush service on the glasses. One week later I was called and told the glasses were ready.  When I went in to pick them up on my lunch I was so disappointed.  They were now trying to give me plain old glasses with the line across the lenses.  I did not want to try them on but the representative insisted.  I told her I was not blind that I could clearly see the line on the lenses so they could not be my glasses.  She insisted that I needed to try them on.  I told her that I want a refund and NO I am not trying the glasses on.  She said she would go get a manager.  I sat there for 15 minutes waiting.  I then met with Diana the Manager.  I was clear that I wanted a refund that I was patient and they had three chances to do my glasses and they could not get the job done.  I am going on vacation next week and I am going on vacation with my glasses and you have not been capable up to this point.  Diana then stated that she would  personally take care of my glasses and that they would be correct and that I would have them in time for my vacation.  She said she would give me a discount for the inconvenience I had been experiencing.  She looked me in the eye and gave me her word.  I looked her back in the eye and said if you do not get it right I will contact her corporate office and then I would find every review place I can to share my experience.  I picked the glasses up today.  I met with Diana and asked if she had checked them and is everything I paid for there and she said yes.  She put my lenses in the glasses and I tried them on.  The glasses seemed to be ok.  Things looked a little fuzzy and the ground appeared to be moving.  I was told there is an adjustment time and that it would clear up soon.  We went outside and I tried them on and they seemed to be more shaded than my old pair of glasses.  We went in and she did some more adjustments to the glasses and cleaned them.  I again asked her if all the features I paid for are on the glasses and she said yes.  She went outside again with the glasses while I was waiting and she checked them in the sun.  Diana said yes everything is on the glasses that you ordered.  I was running late on my lunch hour and was feeling rushed to get back to the office.  Diana refunded $39.99 on the glasses for the inconvenience I experienced.  When I got home tonight and stood out in the sun for five minutes, nothing happened.  The lenses do not darken at all.  The lenses do appear to have a thick anti-glare coating.  There definitely is no change to the lenses when standing in direct sunlight.  I will return tomorrow morning and get my refund.  I am concerned that they will make the refund difficult, but if a refund is not given then I would have to call their actions fraudulent. I had insurance that paid a portion of the bill.  The insurance company has also been charged for an item not received. If necessary I will be calling the fraud department at United Health Care. I have been deceived and feel like a foolish woman.  I am foolish to the tune of \n$ 793.90.  I will follow up this post with the results of my visit tomorrow where I intend to get a refund.\n5-5-2013 Went back this morning to return the glasses.  The representative put them under a special lite they had and presto the glasses got dark. We then went outside and the glasses were definitely darker.  I really felt like something was wrong because I had the glasses outside at home for an hour in and out of the sunlight and they never got dark like they did at the store. The glasses are still fuzzy when I try to read small print.  I am going to bring them to my eye doctor to have them checked to see if they have been made to the prescription that I was given. I also double checked my paperwork and noticed a $135.00 copay I was charged.  My benefits show that I have a $25.00 copay.

Let's just say that after the incident, the process of moving from sitting to standing and vice versa was quite painful and had not improved in a day and a half.  I decided to go to urgent care on a Saturday afternoon.\n\nI have not been to an urgent care in a few years and I was happy with my experience at CHW in Ahwatukee.  Saturday afternoon seems like a good time to go.  There was only one other person in the waiting room.\n\nLess than 5 minutes and my name was called.  The nurse that did the initial assessment and took my vitals was very friendly and caring, more than any other nurse I have interacted with in the last few years.\n\nShe offered to carry my purse back to the room, asked me if I wanted some water to drink or a cold pack for my back.  She took the pillow from the bed (since I couldn't lay on it because of my back) and set it up in the chair for me.  Then she turned on the TV (in the exam room?!) and put the nurses call button over the bed so I could reach it if needed.\n\nNot much to say about the doctor.  He asked a few questions and checked my (limited) mobility.  When talking to him I felt a little rushed, as if he was already on to the next question before I had finished my answer to the first.  Then again, I have had a hurt back before, so I already had an idea there wasn't much he could do for me other than give me something to help with the pain.  I wasn't expecting much, just drugs.\n\nThen a different guy came in to explain my prescriptions to me.  I really appreciated that.

I work in a local hospital and decided that I wanted a more personal, natural experience for my birth. The midwives and nurses at Babymoon Inn are partners in your healthcare instead of the deciders. They empower you with knowledge to make the decisions instead of making them for you. My midwife was Connie and I loved seeing her for appointments and having her at my delivery.\n\nThe office is comfortable and spa-like. Everyone knows who you are when you check in and there is a fully stocked kitchen that they encourage you get food and drinks from. You have an entire hour to spend with your midwife at each appointment to discuss anything and everything. Should you have a question after hours, you can leave a voicemail and someone calls you back right away, very much unlike a regular doctor's office. They will even text you if you like to communicate that way. \nThe classes are first-rate and really prepare you for both the labor and taking care of yourself and the baby afterwards. \n\nEven though this is a natural birthing center, they do have lots of medical equipment should it be necessary. Since I do work in a hospital, it was great to see that they could take care of anything that could happen. \n\nSometimes when people hear the term \"birthing center\", the connotation is that it is \"hippie-ish\". This place is quite the opposite. It is very professionally run and provides the best prenatal, labor, delivery, and postpartum care. Every detail is paid attention to. I would recommend every healthy pregnant woman to deliver here. As of right now, they only take Blue Cross Blue Shield Insurance, but if you have to pay cash, this place is well worth it. I would have paid twice as much to have such an amazing experience. But a lot of times, your copays for a hospital delivery will get pretty close to the fee of Babymoon Inn, so it might end up costing about the same including all of the prenatal visits, classes, and postpartum visits.\n\nMy birth here was wonderful, peaceful, and they let me guide the delivery, which was extremely important to me. The would occasionally monitor me and the baby, but let me do things exactly how I wanted to do them, including my husband catching the baby. It was an amazing experience and because the classes prepare you so well, it was not that painful. Never once did I think I needed a hospital or any kind of intervention. I was prepared so well by Babymoon Inn that I knew everything was normal and natural. I was so empowered that I was able to block out the pain. And the great thing is, not having the interventions women normally have in the hospital made my recovery be almost nothing. We were back home in our own bed just a few hours afterwards. I did not want to be in a hospital with someone telling me when I could leave or not.\nAnother awesome thing about Babymoon Inn is that you also have a doula, Diane, who is phenomenal. Her class was a powerful experience and she even takes pictures during the birth. \n\nI interviewed at Babymoon Inn and another birthing center in the valley, and I am so happy I decided to choose Babymoon Inn. I chose Babymoon Inn because they do so much more than midwifery. They have nurses, lactation consultants, classes, massages, and a doula. It was also far more professional. I feel so lucky that we have a place like this here in the valley. I will definitely deliver all of my future children there!\nI encourage everyone to check into this place, it drastically exceeds the \"normal\" physician/hospital birthing experience.", "business_id": "06EgUvLQBTXJrLKyv41mxA", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-06-24", "type": "review"}

This man is a greedy con artist. I went to see him after a year or two of avoiding the dentist, and in need of a general checkup and teeth cleaning. I went to him due to a Groupon that seemed to have a good deal. Unfortunately, when I got there, he did the usual, x-rays, exam and everything, but then sternly and authoritatively told me I have not just gingivitis, but periodontal disease. For those that don't know, this is a very serious disease that involves bacteria so far underneath the teeth that they are literally eating away at the bone. Pretty serious stuff that just happened to require a $1000 extra deep cleaning that he was willing to do for me. \nTotally freaked out, I went to MATC here in Madison and got a teeth cleaning for $30 where they also took x-rays and had two dentists on duty. Without me even asking them, both dentists said I have excellent teeth and that it's quite obvious I've been taking good care of them. Even the students who cleaned my teeth commented on this initially. I then asked them about the periodontal disease, and if gingivitis is even a possibility. Both of them said no, not in the slightest, but took another look at my x-rays just to be sure, ultimately making the same assessment. Once again, they told me my teeth were in excellent condition.\nNow my father happens to be a dentist as well, but he's been retired for some time. Nonetheless, I sent both sets of x-rays to him, from Dr. Lee and MATC, and asked him his opinion. He concurred with the MATC dentists that I most certainly do not have periodontal disease or even gingivitis, and he strongly advised me to no longer go to Dr. Lee. Obviously, I never will, but I want other people to understand what a scam artist this guy is. Do not go to him, unless you want to be lied to and have your money taken from you.\nOh, and I wanted to add this little part as well. After they told me very sternly that I have periodontal disease, I lightheartedly said \"Well, looks like it's time to turn the ship around then, and do what I can do reverse course.\" I expected at least the tiniest bit of encouragement from them, but none was forthcoming. In fact, the vibe I got was a very strong attitude of paternalistic judgment. Very odd and offputting. I now see it was part of the act. Whatever you do, don't go there.

The front desk lady, Debbie, was beyond nasty to me every time we spoke. I decided I'd rather lose out on the money than ever step foot in that place again. \n\nWhen I called to set up the consultation, it was about 6 weeks before the expiration date. I tried asking Debbie if I would have enough time to get all the treatments in if I waited a week because of my work schedule. ( I knew nothing about the LipoLaser stuff, like how long to wait between appts.)  She retorted snottily with how she doesn't know my schedule and that can't tell me when to make my appointment. So rude!!\n\nRegardless, I made an appointment for the consultation for the following week. Upon arriving there was no one at the front desk or in the waiting room.  I stood at the front desk for about 3 mins before Dr. Gallagher greeted me and told me to have a seat and \"Debbie knew I was coming and should be right back.\"  I waited for over 10 minutes wondering why I wasn't filling out paperwork or something proactive. Debbie never showed.  The Doc came back out and gave me some forms to fill out.  I did that. Then waited another 8 mins or so. It finally became apparent that Debbie was not coming back so the Doc gave me a brief tour. He was friendly enough, the consultation seemed pointless and definitely unorganized.  The \"tour\" took about 5 mins.  I made an appt. for my first session the following week. \n\nI gave myself 30 mins to get there for what would be normally a 15 drive.  However, it happened to be the crazy fluke day that it started snowing in Scottsdale. Traffic was significantly worse than normal.  Five mins before my appt. time I called Touch of Health, trying to be considerate and explain that because of the random insane weather I may be a few mins late.  Debbie answered. I explained that I've been sitting on the 101 for 20 mins and could be a few mins a late.  She snapped at me and said \"Well, I'm sitting here waiting on you!\"  I was flabbergasted and appalled. I wasn't even late yet, and I was being scolded by a receptionist?! I couldn't even handle the rudeness anymore. So I responded with \"Well, funny. I was waiting on you for my consultation...\" She cut me off and got super defensive with how \"No, no. You're weren't waiting on me. The Doctor helped you!\"  I realized it was pointless to argue with this awful receptionist, yet I was enraged at this moment. I told her I certainly wasn't planning on traffic being awful and the situation. \"We'll if you're more than 15 mins late you'll have to reschedule.'' I decided to just forget it at this point, and told her I wanted to reschedule. I had no desire to be yelled at further by this lady with a severe attitude problem.  Instead of rescheduling me then, she told me to call back tomorrow. \n\nI did not call back.  What a terrible experience from beginning to end.  The coupon I  bought was not cheap but I refuse to have any interaction with Debbie again.  She made me feel unappreciated and just plan awful with her nasty tone and nasty words. I don't know if I received such awful treatment because I was using the coupon, but I should've been treated with the same respect as everybody else.  I don't know how the place would still be open if Debbie treats all patients/customers in such a rude despicable manner. \n\nI wish I could leave no stars!", "business_id": "pUdnjDKHP6JOmR_Fy52j6A", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-03-10", "type": "review"}

He also likes to focus on preventative medicine and making easy lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, etc.) in lieu of prescribing a bunch of pricey drugs. If you need a drug he'll find the best one for you, but he won't rush to load you up with a ton of meds. He also orders bloodwork and lab tests yearly and I really feel like he keeps on top of my health to catch any problem areas BEFORE they become major problems. \n\nNobody likes going to the doctor, but this place makes it a heck of a lot easier.

And it will take 2 to 4 weeks and need a specialist to make it for the dentist.\nOf course I opt for the resin, and since I was going to pay in cash they give 10% discount. Anyway, the job didn't take more then 10 min to be done, if you ask me if I'm happy with the service, I will say it didn't worth how much I paid for, the color of the resin don't even match my teeth and I have to ask Doc Kim to make fill it more to look more natural and similar to the format of my teeth.\nThey charged me also a consultation fee, I think it was totally unfair since I got the job done with them and I already said what I need and they didn't even examined my mouth to see if I was going to need more things done... Anyway, I was in a rush and I didn't have time to argue, I end up paying $256.90 in cash for a service I was not happy with.\nI don't recommend this place and of course they will never see me again.\nRipoff!!!", "business_id": "95y5iJufX4ZJO2ojZaS6rg", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-02-08", "type": "review"}

I will start by saying that I have been going to summerlin hospital since I found out that I was pregnant. They offer many birthing classes. I attending natural birth methods, breast feeding basics, and a car seat safety check.  The price of the classes were under $60 and the car seat check and brith tour were both free.\nI have birth to my daughter here and was very impressed with the nursing staff. Everyone was extremely nice and made me feel safe and appreciated. I felt like a person not a patient.\n The delivery room was large with a tv and private bathroom. There was enough seating for up to 6 guests.  The postpartum room was about half the size of the delivery room but comfy. There is one lounge for someone to stay the night with you that folded down into a sleeper. We asked for sheets and a pillow and the nurse actually made up the bed for my husband.  It is a requirement that the hospital keep you for 24hours after natural birth (longer if C-Section). \nThe food was not that great but its free.  I also liked how they brought a celebration dessert with sparkling cider and flutes to toast! That was a surprising treat!\nI kept saying that it was like The Four Seasons hospital because of how clean and professional everything was. It was a great a great experience and highly recommend delivering at the hospital. \n\nThe ER room is why I gave 4 stars. There was no sense in urgency when I had a newborn that needed to be seen . There was only one person assisting in the ER. Once we were in the room to be seen by the doctor ER waiting 45 mins. That wad too long to wait with a 4 week old.

Well, I'm here to tell you that it was a bad recommendation. I made my appointment and was told to download the paperwork. I don't have a printer, so I stopped in to pick up the paperwork. They couldn't locate me in the system. Turns out, they had entered my information incorrectly. I'm not a fan of a medical office making mistakes, but they are human, so I excuse it. \n\nI show up for my appointment. I'm pleased that I don't have to wait--they take me right in. A medical assistant (MA) takes the basics (vitals and history). Shortly thereafter, a physicians assistant (PA) enters. I was not told I'd be seeing a PA rather than a medical doctor. I'm not against PAs, mind you, I just think that when I call to make a DOCTOR appointment, I should be told I'd be seeing a PA. \n\nThe PA continues the history. I tell her about the issues I'm having--headaches, difficulty with weight loss (I used to be a personal trainer, so I have helped many individuals lose weight), and other digestion all issues. She tells me to drink more water (although I told her that I've been trying that to no avail) and to eat less sweets (without asking about my diet which includes very little sweets). She felt as though she didn't listen to me at all. \n\nI was asked to change into a paper gown vest type thing and place a paper blanket type thing on my lap for the exam.  During the course of the exam, the vest completely ripped so I basically was wearing two sleeves and covering myself with my hands. \n\nThe PA performed a gyn exam that was so painful, I expected to look down to see that she was using a machete to examine me. \n\nAfter the exam, I get sent to the area for lab services. Yes, very convenient to have that all in one place. \n\nA few days later I get a call that the lab results are in. I attempt to call back, yet I am placed on hold for a tremendous amount of time. This happens twice. Finally on the third call, someone comes back on the line and they tell me they can read me the results but they cannot answer any questions. Apparently,  they were unable to find an MA to talk to me. Turns out there were some irregularities in my labs. I pick up copies of the labs, and I make a file follow up appointment. Two days later I received a letter from the PA indicating that she is unable to reach me, and that I need to contact them and provide my correct contact information.\n\nI call again a few days later to find out the results of other labs that were performed. Same thing happens: I call, I'm put on hold, no MA available. They call me and leave a message.  I call back, I'm put on hold and no MA available. I finally decided to stop and pick up all the lab results and make an appointment with another doctor.

In asking the owner I found out \"Just Plus\" had opened at this location in December and was offering an additional 20% off until the end of April.  With time to kill I decided to take the plunge and commit to my first ever  foot massage.  \n\nThe owner sat me down on one of the four cushy chairs while I relaxed.  In a few moments Cindy came with the bucket of just the right temp water/tea mixture.  My feet were wrapped in plastic and chair inclined.  I received a totally comfy head, shoulder and arm massage for ten minutes or so followed by the foot massage.  Each foot was worked on one at a time and felt good even with ticklish feet.  The only down side was a few moments of mild \"pain\" when the  arch of each foot was massaged.

We used to see the dentist at Silver State Smiles-- Dr. Tongsiri and her crew. They were gracious, honest and a really nicely ran little office. Oh yes, our appointments sometimes ran late, but the feeling of the office wasn't customers coming in for an appointment-- but family popping by and being taking care of. Since I have four children-- I truly enjoyed knowing that we were being taken care of and not simply customers. The crew also never tried to 'upsell' procedures.\n\nWell-- as things do-- all good things must come to an end. Silver State Smiles merged with Image Dental. Now, my family member went in for a cleaning-- normal cleaning-- no biggie and expected to see Dr. Tongsiri. Who did he see? A stranger. Well, that's okay, right? As long as they're good at what they do and honest. Even though they merged with Silver State Smiles-- they demanded a redo on his current xrays. Okay-- it's not a huge procedure and the insurance company will pay for new xrays-- go ahead. That's fine. But then they said he needed a deep cleaning-- which isn't covered by dental insurance and they know it-- and he actually does not need a deep cleaning.\n\nWarning bells ring out! I am sickened by dentists who try to upsell procedures that are not necessary to clients. This family member is already very leery of dentists and it took me many many years to find a dentist he'd be willing to go to-- well, hey, guess what? Not anymore.\n\nI'm also very irate that they are demanding new xrays on everyone even though they merged with the other office. It's enough work to get my kids' cleanings done on time, but to demand xrays that don't need to be done just so they can pad their pockets with the new clients? Draw your own conclusion.\n\nSo I had a family appointment for me and my children to go to the dentist this week. I called to cancel and when I talked to the receptionist-- I stated that I was not satisfied with my family member's treatment there and the receptionist? She yawned. I said I'd like to cancel, but if Carla or any of the other members of the staff from Silver State Smiles would like to call me and discuss the issues my family member had, I could literally hear the receptionist's eyeballs clacking back in her head as she rolled her eyes at me. \"I'll just cancel the appointment.\"\n\nThey really do care about their clientele at Image Dental, don't they?", "business_id": "hkHipyTdUQToHRzHEQY-fQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-12-29", "type": "review"}

They asked about alcohol consumption. I don't drink, but the EMTs figured it was food poisoning. They said about half of their calls are food poisoning. It's very common on The Strip. They asked me about my dinner, I told them it was Panda Express, and they said it was probably \"bad Panda\". (This was in the Venetian. Will never eat there again, and to date have never eaten at any other Panda!)\n\nThey put me in a wheelchair (the hotel cooperated wonderfully) and we went to the hospital by ambulance. They started an IV en route. I freaking hate IVs but they had no choice, given the duration of vomiting and obvious dehydration. They were very careful and stayed completely unruffled. They were angels. Amazing how sweet and calm they are with such a stressful job, in the middle of the damn night! \n\nWhen we arrived at Sunrise, it was odd to see nurses smoking, but it was Vegas after all. \n\nThey put me in a private room with a fantastic nurse. The doctor saw me right away, a really sweet guy with a smile and good bedside manner. They made sure I was totally comfortable with blankets (IVs can make you freaking COLD!! Brrr!) and a place for my sweetheart to sit. \n\nAs sweet as they were, I wanted to get the hell out and said so. I was a damn mess. They said I could leave as soon as I peed. Pee is their indicator that the dehydration has been solved. The staff all remained cheerful throughout.\n\nThe doctor explained that the eateries on The Strip often serve old, unfit for consumption food because they are open 24 hours. You never know what you're going to get. The sanitation is questionable and freshness often nil. Made us want to just get groceries and make our own food next time we're in Vegas. \n\nHours went by, and I finally peed. They let me go, and even let me take a plastic barf pan with me in case I had any more nausea. I still have it to this day, and it's pink, so it coordinates with my office. They gave me a prescription for nausea pills. The pills were great, they really helped. (Of course if you are passing contaminated food or something, that needs to come out, and the pills won't stop that.)\n\nThe missing star is for the exit wait. We had to wait quite a while for the staff at the counter to take our payment. It wasn't busy, so we didn't know what the holdup was. In my condition, it seemed like forever. That did allow some time for a cab to show up, to get back to our hotel. \n\nI glanced at the other reviews and am so sad that so many have had terrible experiences. I guess we truly lucked out because it could have been dreadful. I don't ever look forward to getting sick but Sunrise made it a much less atrocious experience than it could have ended up.\n\nThe Venetian was incredible in letting us extend our stay for another night, even though we hadn't reserved it, because I was too frail to get on a plane when the sun came up. We changed our return flight. They were pretty booked up too, so we were very appreciative. \n\nThey also provided a wheelchair for me to get downstairs, through the lobby, and out to the cab when the time came. If you've been to the Venetian, you know that's a lot of real estate to cover. It's gigantic. One of the biggest properties in the world. \n\nIf you find yourself vomiting so hard and for so long that blood is coming out and you're too hoarse to speak, don't ignore it! Call the paramedics (the hotel did it for us) and re-hydrate. Dehydration can kill.", "business_id": "mBGzE7gsSwsnVSAhsdvSJQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-12-02", "type": "review"}

While I exam was covered under my insurance, this \"fitting fee\" ate up over 2/3 of my insurance allowance for contacts the year.  I'm sorry but to charge $95 to for a \"fitting fee\" to basically have the doctor tell me that my current contacts fit perfectly?  I've been wearing contacts for about 18 years, have had many different insurance plans and gone to many optometrists, and have never experience this level of exorbitant price gauging.  \n\nI would warn anyone to be careful about this place.  I was also told that they do not have prices for their frames and you will have to pick out everything (frames, lens, etc.) before they will give you a price.  Undoubtly to make you fall for a pair of glasses and then be told they cost $600 or something.  \n\nI for one will not be a patron of a place that keeps so much hidden from their customers ever again.  Even if you have money to throw away, I suggest you throw it away elsewhere.", "business_id": "RqZctFR39-ZFkBEFTA1GyQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-11-25", "type": "review"}

Everyone. And how many people ACTUALLY paid that (plus tax)? Nobody. That's what I thought. \n\nLike I said, I'm not complaining because I knew I wanted one of my frames to be made into sunglasses which costs more, but this place does find other ways to nickel & dime you as well. They will talk you in to paying an extra $15 with your eye exam to get tested for glaucoma. I hadn't had an eye exam in 4 years so I went ahead and did this. I have to say, the optometrist who did my exam (as well as the assistant) were very nice. I actually realized when I pulled up to the building I had an eye exam here like 7-8 years ago. They still had my information on file & funny enough, the same optometrist from back then examined me this time (I recognized him & he mentioned it was definitely his hand writing in my file).  \n\nThe woman who helped me with my frames was nice as well. I mean, yeah, she tried to talk to me into an upgrade here & one there, but I immediately told her I wanted one of my frames to be sunglasses so I think she was a little less aggressive on that front knowing I was gonna spend more than the \"standard\" deal right off the bat. I STILL thought I had paid too much for everything, but when I got home I called around to compare (yeah, I'm THAT person) & realized that getting RX sunglasses really does cost a lot of $$$ and I probably didn't pay anymore here than I would have at other places (including Walmart & Costco) for all that I got. \n\nI went to pick up my frames today and was VERY happy. I actually called them to see if they were possibly ready a little earlier than expected (I really wanted/needed my new sunglasses), and sure enough they were!\n\nAt the end of the day I'm not sure if the savings here is as great as it might first appear, but I certainly don't think you get ripped off. And for the service & quality of the frames I would definitely recommend America's Best...at least this location", "business_id": "AIr3Xtgsm9BHQs1_IM_ppA", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-07-03", "type": "review"}

I was fed up with the questionable, indifferent, and invasive and yet incomplete treatment at my old gyn office. My friend told me so many great things about Camelback over the last couple of years, yet I still stuck with my old gyno thinking things would get better and that their methods were probably the same as every other facility's anyway. But three years and five invasive and useless colposcopies later, nothing had changed. \n\nWell, you know how they say that sometimes you don't realize how bad things truly were until you experience the difference? They're right. \n\nI saw Julie Bergdale, NP supreme and all the hype on Yelp about her is true. The most striking thing besides her kind, smart, funny and compassionate demeanor is that she actually listens, truly LISTENS to you and absorbs your info, even the subtle bits. She wanted to know all about my health history, my concerns, and habits. For the first time since I moved here from CA, I felt like I was going to be cared for properly by my gyno office! (I left my truly awesome gyno of 18 years, Dr., Gerardo Bustillo, back in CA and so regretted it. But now, I think I may have some hope of a great experience again.)\n\nI had to wait longer than at my old place, but that's no biggee because it's only due to Julie spending quality time with each patient. And for that, I'm HAPPY to wait! What good is efficiency without quality? For the first time in three years of living in AZ, I got ALL of my many questions answered. Not danced around or dismissed, but answered intelligently and thoroughly. I'm the kind of a patient who knows my body well and takes the time to read books and studies and asks questions, so I need an office that not only doesn't mind but that prefers well-informed patients. Julie decided to do a full metabolic panel, plus CRP, plus cholesterol (amazing) and a hormone panel to boot based on my family history. This should really help establish a nice baseline from where to work. Sensible.\n\nWhy this was never done at my old office, I do not know. The staff and doctor absolutely hated questions, and as she reminded me many a time, placed the weight of their decisions on predetermined, one-size-fits-all protocols. My last phone conversation with my doctor, (a full 3.5 weeks after a mysteriously painful and stressful biopsy episode that threw my period off by two weeks) was very sad indeed. The gist of it? Apparently everything is the patient's fault at her office, even when monsels solutions may be mixed wrong and cause reactions....Very disappointing, yet not surprising. Nothing had changed. That's when I knew I really had to leave.\n\nBut not to worry. They say many times out of adversity comes understanding and positive change. After coming to Camelback, I know now that my last bad experience served as a painful wake-up call to me about my health and being more proactive and engaged moving forward. For the first time in years, I have high hopes of great care for the future. If the NP is this good, I believe this bodes well for the doctors. \n\nOh, and as a bonus, they have places that do mammograms and bone scans right downstairs from their office, so if you need those like I do, you can add convenience to their list of attributes, too.", "business_id": "nEaJwY77drRqQkJqcd9LRg", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-05-25", "type": "review"}

After realizing that my throat was oddly swollen on one side, I went to the Walgreens clinic and was diagnosed with a \"mystery infection\". 10 days of antibiotics later, the infection hadn't gone away. I was recommended to Valley ENT by a friend and the first time I called, I spoke with Lauren.\n\nLauren was incredibly pleasant and encouraging during this first call. My insurance had lapsed after I was laid off, and I was stuck needing a doctor with no insurance. Lauren encouraged me to have COBRA reinstate my insurance, but told me that in the mean time, the first office visit would be $250 (which covered all procedures done in office). Of course, that sounded steep, so I said I would think about it.\n\nThat night, my fever spiked to 102-- the next day, I called Lauren back, begging for an appointment. The doctor who I was originally referred to (whose name I can't remember) was unavailable, but Lauren said she could get me in THAT DAY with Dr. Heiland. I happily took the appointment.\n\nFirst Appointment: Sept 4th \nMy boyfriend drove me to the office for my 3 o'clock appointment. We ended up waiting for a full hour before I was seen. Of course, I was unhappy (and sick) about this, but I often expect to wait in doctor's offices. During our wait, we checked out the massive fish tank. The office staff offered us bottles of water and magazines and apologized for the wait.\n\nI was called back and the medical assistant (I think) escorted me into the exam room. She was nice, took my temperature and got some details from me. Dr. Heiland came in shortly thereafter and all I can say is wow. \n\nLet me list out the reasons I was so impressed:\n1. Dr. Heiland sat down, away from the computer, with a pen and pad of paper. He said that he had read over my chart, but wanted me to describe to him what had been going on. I'm a SUPER detailed person, so I rattled off the whole story. Dr. Heiland scrawled notes the whole time, asked me more detailed questions, and even included my boyfriend in the conversation. His full attention given to me the whole time. Awesome. He even had a sense of humor, which is always welcome.\n1a. When Dr. Heiland had to examine me, he informed me that I had nice ears and teeth and that my nasal cavity curved to the left. This entire exchange was really fun/funny-- and totally nerdy. Two thumbs up.\n2. Dr. Heiland was really knowledgeable about all things ear-nose-and throat (and it was clear). He explained that I had an infected lymph node, why it was making me feel the way it was, what we would do if it got better, and what we would do if it didn't.\n3. At no point during our encounter was I lost in \"doctor jargon\". If anything was unclear, and either my boyfriend or myself asked, Dr. Heiland would explain more in detail. Not at all condescending, but completely helpful.\n4. When giving me another 3 week dose of antibiotics, Dr. Heiland recommended a brand of probiotic pills and Activia yogurt to help my system. He even prescribed an anti-fungal in advance, in case it became an issue. This made me feel like he was really considering my whole body/looking at the big picture.\n5. I got all of this great service DESPITE my not having insurance. He also encouraged me to get COBRA, as if we needed to remove the lymph node, it would be expensive-- but he didn't make me feel bad about not having insurance. Kind and supportive all around.\n\nOur appointment lasted at least an hour, if not more. The entire staff stayed after the office had closed, because we were the last patients to leave. They didn't rush us out, everyone was so nice. We were blown away.\n\nInitially, I deducted 1 star from my review for the hour wait, but when I realized how much time and attention Dr. Heiland dedicated to each patient, I added the star back, because no one likes being rushed, and it is important to really HEAR your patients.\n\nSecond Appointment: October 4th @ 2.\nMy infection had resolved itself, thank goodness! I went in for a follow up appointment just to verify. My appointment was at 2, but again, we didn't see Dr. Heiland until later (shrug). Once we did, Dr. Heiland was really nice and funny, as usual. The visit/exam was only about 10 minutes. He did explain precautions/what to do in the future, but it was an in and out kind of office experience.\n\nPerhaps the best part was that when my boyfriend and I left the exam room, the two medical assistants AND the office staff stood up and shouted \"Yay!\" and clapped for my lack of infection. It was seriously adorable. \n\nI maintain 5 stars for this entire situation, despite the tardiness. I really valued being listened to and being treated like a whole person. I think it's great that Dr Heiland's whole office team are so nice. I like EVEN MORE that he treated my infection and it went away.

I had one doctor tell me my receding gums were due to clenching and grinding and then I was told it was due to aggressive brushing. I was then sold a $600 bite plate to protect my teeth and gums either way. I found that each doctor had his own beliefs and stressed them when they worked on you. This is confusing and leads the patient to believe they are not all on the same page. \n\n2nd - They are too quick to blame the patient for technical errors or equipment difficulties. After having to sit for 3 molds and coming several times for fittings the facial plate on my bite plate broke and Dr. Margolis blamed me directly for not heating the bit plate up. I actual did and found I didn't need to as the device fit fine without heating but I warmed it up under the warm tap water anyway. But when I tried to confront Dr. Margolis and say that it was not my fault he became upset and left the room. I believe the resin mixture was off for the 3rd time and the flexibility of the material was compromised. But they insisted that the 3rd fitting was 100% okay and a success and that it was my fault. They suddenly said that if you do not heat it and keep it at a specific temperature while in use it will not be flexible and break. So they said the device had to be warmed because in the mouth it is kept at a constant specific temperature so it can be flexible. I can hardly think that the mouth can keep anything at a specific temperature while you sleep. A thermometer is placed under the tongue for a reason. The bottom line is the facial plates are unnecessary and the resin mixture was most probably off causing the material to be brittle and break at the thinner weak parts of the mold. But instead of taking care of your customer you attempted to blame me. \n\n3rd - Dr. Kovar likes to talk down to his patients and make things up to explain what he believes to be true. A basic understanding of biology, chemistry and other sciences had me cringing at some of the things he said. I actually have an education in physics but he is unaware of that and made several statements that embarrassed me to hear him say as a dentist. They treat patients as if they do not know anything and you are always wrong. Everything is your fault no matter what. And they will make up facts to support your ignorance.\n\n4th - If you have any complaints and voice them they will get upset with you and basically tell you to get out. Dr. Kovar decided not to finish my appointment after I expressed my grievances as he was telling me brushing and flossing ELIMINATES 100% of bacteria in the mouth. If you know anything about biology and bacteria you know that is impossible. The mouth is full of bacteria at any given time and brushing and flossing alone will not eliminate it in its entirety. It will reduce it not eliminate it. Brushing alone does not remove all of the plaque (bacteria) from the surface of your teeth. Decay causing bacteria still linger between teeth where toothbrush bristles can't reach. Flossing removes plaque and food particles from between the teeth and under the gum line. The purpose of both brushing and flossing is to REDUCE the amount of bacteria that inhabits your mouth. There were other instances in which he seemed to make things up to back what he was saying. \n\n5th - Furthermore he said a bite plate does not lock in any leftover bacteria in between the teeth and the bite plate. That is impossible if we cannot remove all of the bacteria to begin with. So a bite plate may indeed be causing an extraordinary pocket buildup of leftover bacteria which can then lead to premature tooth decay. But Dr. Kovar instead tried to make up things to deny this completely. Just admit it is certainly possible. I was thinking this because all of a sudden I was getting a cavity or two every time I had a visit and they were all on the top teeth. He then basically blamed me for the cavities by saying it was impossible if you brush and floss before putting the bite plate in. I spend more time than the average person brushing, flossing with the special tool they gave me, using antiseptic rinse, and following with multiple water rinses. I do not eat a bunch of candy either. No soda. I don't even chew gum or the like because I have jaw problems.\n\n6th- They try way too hard to convince you to remove all your metal fillings only to replace them with a resin. I have had metal amalgams for many years and I have no issues with them. But I was constantly made to feel stupid for leaving in my metal fillings. And their use of a mask to remove mercury amalgams is a joke. They make you pay for this mask and then go through putting a bunch of hoses and equipment on your face which hurts as Dr. Kovar leans on this crap pushing it into your face.

After all, aren't all children's doctors supposed to be warm and caring and full of puppies and rainbows?? We're now looking at visiting our 2nd pediatrician's office for our son (and we went through 3 peds at that office). It's not that these doctors are bad or harmful, they're just stand-offish, the receptionists abrupt, and I always leave not completely happy, even though both of my boys are happy and healthy.\n\nI'm hoping that we've found the pediatrician that will give me the same feeling of wonderfulness that I got from Dr. McCleland at Mesa Peds. She was always willing to listen to any and all questions I had and gave this new mama plenty of assurances that I was doing it right. The techs were always awesome and fast with the vaccines; I loved getting the growth charts every time, even though I can chart their growth online at home. \n\nBonus: I never had to wait long for our appointments; I think there was one time that I was in the waiting area longer than 5 minutes. Plus, I was always able to schedule the next well-baby appointment right then. For some reason, the office we started at in CO was unable to schedule appointments more than a month out, and only just moved to a computer system last year (hello, you're about a decade behind). Thankfully, this new one doesn't seem to have that problem. \n\nSide note: We also loved Dr. Piacentine, even though the only time we interacted with him was in the hospital.

Whether you're into athletics, wanting relaxation, or just generally well being, I think getting massages improves your mood. If you're searching for a good place to go, there's a Massage Envy close by...\n\nI frequent this location because of my regular therapist, Socrates, who is amazing. Massage Envy is all over town, very broad flexible hours, with many therapists on staff. They are great to asking your preferences, male or female therapists, what type of massage you'd prefer, providing the typical variety: Swedish, sports, hot stone, deep tissue, etc. \n\nThey charge $49 for your first hour massage. If you decide getting regular massages is right for you, their membership program is a great idea. $59 a month will get you one hour massage every month. What I love about it is you can carry over your massage if you don't use it to the next month. You can even split one up and enjoy an 1.5 hours in one session. I've even skipped a few months (life gets hectic, right?!) and used a 2-hour session after my half marathon last year. Boy, did that come in handy!\n\nYou can also enjoy facials, honestly I haven't had one yet. I've visited a couple locations and used their therapists for almost two years. In my experience, it was a bit of trial and error trying a few massage therapists until I found one I really loved. Through this process though, they've always been professional, courteous, and made me feel comfortable and at ease. They have heated massage tables if you're like me who's cold all the time. I believe now they offer aromatherapy you can add on for $10/15. Massage Envy is great with scheduling, open as early as 8am and closes at 9pm on weekdays. \n\nLook at their website and find a location close by.

Let me backtrack, I haven't seen a dentist in about a year, so I was due for a visit.  I called around my nearby dentist offices and the first two places had an appointment available 3-4 was away!  SunRise dental was my third pick only by distance and they were able to schedule me for the next day, which was for this morning!  Yes, a dentist office that works on weekends!   \n\nSo I went in early to fill out the normal paperwork and such.  The reception area was neat and comfortable.  The receptionist was nice and attentive.  She let me know in advance about my insurance possibilities on how the office would show me what I would pay, after insurance, for procedures done!  Wow! No surprises after the work is done!   :)\n\nI then met my hygienist with smiles and welcomes.  She escorted to the back office area which was clean and well kept.  Took my DIGITAL X-rays and was impressed by the sanitation efforts after the X-rays.  She wiped down everything she touched with those wipe sanitizers!  Yes, DIGITAL X-rays were easier and more comfortable to take than those old film type X-rays of years before!\n\nI was then moved to the examination chair and the hygienist went over what she was going to do and such.  She went over my teeth, checking the gums and teeth.  I knew I haven't been doing well flossing so what she told me wasn't a surprise but she was efficient in the initial procedure.\n\nFrom there she went into my general teeth cleaning, my deep cleaning was going to need insurance approval so that is going to be another day.  So I thought she wasn't going to do much, but she got in there and gave me a good cleaning!  She worked on me for a while and I was impressed by her meticulous attention to detail in getting all that she could in this general cleaning!  She then polished my teeth and I was ready for the examination by the Dr.  \n\nDr Lee was briefed on my sheet/teeth and introduced himself with a good handshake.  He went over my DIGITAL X-rays with me and made me feel comfortable before looking in my mouth as I knew I had at least two cavities that were probably ready to be filled....    His examination was gentle and informative, he noticed I had in fact three cavities and a chipped tooth!  I thought I had a chipped tooth but anyways.....  He said my cavities weren't big gaping holes yet, but they are a good size that now need to be filled.  That, I knew, just didn't want to hear it. :(. \n\nThen the Dr thanked me for coming in shook my hand again.  I was then taken back to the receptionist area, but on the \"inside\" side where there was a comfortable chair to sit in while the receptionist, which by the way, her business card reads, \"insurance/treatment plan coordinator\".  After sitting down with her I agree to that title!  She went over my treatment plan and made suggestions to save me money and appointments!  She was detailed in that she gave me a sheet with all that I needed to have done. With prices!  Now my issuance hasn't been verified, so the prices on the sheet were non insurance prices, but will find out tues feb 11th what will be my out of pocket expenses.  She explained what the picture of the teeth on my sheet and codes.  \n\nShe thanked me for being a new patient and gave me a welcome gift!  I was given a nice reusable shopping bag with something in it!  I didn't look inside till I got home and to my surprise it had a blanket in it!  I know! Wow!  I thought it was going to be something cheesy, but it was a nice throw blanket that I can use to snuggle in front of the TV. :).  I also was given the traditional Baggie of goodies, toothbrush, toothpaste and dental floss. :)\n\nSo here it is, my first visit and review of SunRise Dental.  I was impressed by their friendly customer service, sanitation requirements/attentiveness and at the end the bringing it down to earth by the sit down chat afterwards!  That right there felt that they were interested in me as a person rather than a number where normally at my other dentist all they wanted was a payment and a next appointment date!  So kudos to this whole office for making the visit to the dentist office a pleasant one.   \n\nJM", "business_id": "lFx7VlLggml7_I532tg7Kg", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-02-08", "type": "review"}

My wife was 36 weeks pregnant and having back pain and some contractions on and off. We weren't feeling the baby as much as usual so we went in. The triage nurse hooked us up and started monitoring. We were still not getting much movement so they ordered for an iv to maybe wake him up. After a few minutes they came back in with full staff letting us know they needed to get our son out. He would have a much better chance outside then in. Within 10 minutes she was on the table and I was in the OR with her. A minute later my son was born. They rushed him to the nicu where staff there gave him a blood transfusion and intubated him. A week later, he's doing much better now. \n\nAs for the staff, they were all such wonderful people. From triage, to Dr Chambers who delivered him, to the anesthesiologist and everyone who took care of my wife and son. I'm so beyond thankful we went to this hospital. It may be a bit smaller, but because of that, I felt we had so much more attention. Everyone was very concerned for my wife and child. Even when nurses were off the clock, they'd still be checking in with the nurses in nicu on how our son was doing. \n\nSo once again, THANK YOU to everyone at San Martin.  If you're looking for a place to deliver your baby, definitely take a tour of this great facility. I don't know what we would've done without these great people.

If I can offer 3 hints.\n\n(1)  If you are immunologically challenged  (i.e. have cancer and in chemo, elderly or otherwise need to avoid the sick or crowded areas) I would see if your doctor could set up an in office blood draw. This place is busy and filled with the sick, coughing and sniffling. \n\n(2) I am not the biggest germaphobe [hell I have eaten a chapulin(grasshopper) out of the hand of an old lady selling them on the streets of Mexico] and I am not a fan generally of hand sanitizer, but even I wish they offered a Purell dispenser near the door upon exiting.  The location is not dirty per say but knowing the quaNtity of people that run through here with most of them being all sneezy, sniffly and coughing, statistically speaking there is higher risk of contraction or exposure. Well I kind of feel the same way at a mall, amusement park or airplane.\n\n(3) Make an appointment.  Either call or register online.  If you don't make an appointment go in just after they open (usually around 7a) sign in and wait.  I have been pretty lucky when i have gone early.  The later you go in without an appointment the longer you stand the chance of waiting.  \n \nThe intake staff are professional and helpful.  The process is quicker if you are ready with the necessary forms/cards and you know to sign in as soon as you walk in.   \n\nThe  lab techs and phlebotomists are some of the best.  On my most recent visit the phlebotomist was so smooth.  I could not even feel the transition of the tubes as they filled one and replaced it with another.

They are open until noon on Saturdays.  I know because they squeezed me in on Saturday early afternoon for a check-in with Dr Sheehan.  It was a great experience. Even though it was close to his lunch hour and closing time, he took the time to go over all my questions and make adjustments to my weight loss plan.  \n\nThere are tons of benefits to being with MedShape Weight Loss Clinic, a medically supervised weight loss plan.  For me, it's all about education and structure.  There are so many fad diets with conflicting data, I wanted to make sure I was doing right for my body and losing fat (not weight), in a healthy way.  For my personal experience, MedShape's customizable, medically supervised weight loss program has already been tested in many ways.  \n\nHere are some other perks to their support and structure...\n\n*When I have a question, you can immediately call for answers.\n*During a rough week, you can email or visit support forums and receive suggestions and support.\n*Your individual plan is customized to your needs and lifestyle.  \n* Your Dr and/or support staff will explain what your lifestyle change does for your body, such as lowering the insulin levels for lower fat storage and weight gain.\n*Their custom supplements and prescriptions (if needed) are a good way to condition your body for proper fat loss, instead of just weight loss (which could be muscle instead of fat!).\n* The MedShape protein bars, shakes, drinks and other foods are a nice break from typical meals.  They don't push them at you though, and I've even been told I can be successful without them.  I still get some because some of them are very good! (write me if you want suggestions)\n* The accountability and structure in a medically supervised weight loss program is an important motivator for many personality types.\n\nSo, I guess you can see why I'm loving my MedShape experience.  By spending less money than I spent on a trainer over the last 6 months at the gym, I've already lost 1/2 of my fat loss goal and am not even 1/2 way through my program.  Now I can combine my training instruction and my nutrition plan!  I keep in mind that health success is made up of a bunch of little decisions that I make throughout the day.  \n\nThanks, Dr Sheehan and MedShape Weight Loss!", "business_id": "l76Pnq6nPNXt1ZpgqnYS0w", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-06-30", "type": "review"}

This particular location is identified as the closest office based on the zip code I provided when calling their toll-free number.\n\nI went just after noon on a Tuesday and was expecting a long painful wait without having scheduled an appointment, but was happily surprised that it wasn't too long.  While I sat in the waiting room that can seat about 20, I was catching up on the news that was being reported on the HLN channel on a small television in the corner. \n\nOnce I was called in by the nurse, I was directed to one of the rooms to have what seems like a lot of vials of blood samples collected.  During the 4-5 minutes process, she kept making small talks to make the procedure less boring and possibly distract patients that maybe afraid of the needles/procedure.  She was very efficient and made the entire process as painless as possible.\n\nThe lady in the front that checks you in is also very nice.\n\nSo if you are ever in need of services from a Quest Diagnostics office, I would recommend this location if you live or work near this location. There are plenty of parking, and if you need some food or beverage right afterwards, Boba City Cafe is just a few suites down on the right.\n\n5 for availability of parking\n4 for condition of the office\n4 for the friendly and efficient services provided\n4 for costs, which will vary depending on your insurance coverage.\n3 for the automated phone number to locate the nearest office and scheduling appointments.\n\nOverall, a solid 4 stars rating.", "business_id": "hkGUrbJeIAUtOQ_5mRmy9A", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-07-27", "type": "review"}

I came here for a second opinion consultation, and they have now earned my business as a regular patient.\n\nHere's my story:\nSo I went to my general dentist for a cleaning and check-up, while I was there I had voiced some concern over some discoloration in my front tooth. After some further x-rays my dentist determined that my front tooth is dead (RIP front tooth)! \n\nOnce a tooth dies it can become discolored over time, and continue to darken. I wasn't surprised at the news since I had Googled my symptoms, so the diagnosis made sense. That being said, I've never even had a cavity in my life, so I'm really unfamiliar with dental work. My dentist said the only option would be a crown, I asked how exactly a crown worked and he said they would have to shave my tooth down and then put a crown on top (scary)! Since this is a purely aesthetic procedure, insurance doesn't cover it and the price for a crown is over $1,000.\n\nAfter some further research I decided to get a second opinion as a crown seemed really aggressive, and I wanted to discuss all of my options. Being so unfamiliar with dental work I really just needed some hand holding on this one. \n\nTo Yelp I went, and searched for the top rated Cosmetic Dentist. Simply Dentistry had all 5 star reviews, so I called them up, explained my situation, and they were able to fit me in within the week.\n\nI walked into the office and Brittany knew who I was, and exactly what I was there for. I didn't have to re-explain my situation (so nice!). She then gave me a tour of the office and it's amenities, which included a computer to use, complimentary water, cable TV with remote privileges, and a comfortable waiting room. I filled out my paperwork, had x-rays taken, and then had my exam with Dr. Tran. She really listened to my concerns, and we had a lengthy conversation about what my options were. She said that she thought a crown was an extremely aggressive approach, and suggested whitening instead (whitening is currently 50% as a 5 year anniversary special). This was not an option given to me at my other dentist. I chose the whitening option and saved about $900! \n\nThis is an honest and trustworthy office, that just saved me a large amount of money, and they've proven that they really care about their patients.

I wish I could remember her name (I went a few months ago) because she was great, really personable and skilled. \n\nMy actual experience with the dentist (not sure which one, I'm bad with names!) was brief and felt a little rushed, but I'm not taking off a star because leaving the office with my mouth feeling simply clean and happy instead of painful and bruised is so awesome. And he didn't see much of concern in my mouth so I can't blame him for not stopping to chat.

I had always wondered how painful it would be to have a Brazilian waxing as part of what people term \"manscaping.\" I have tried other methods that seem to last a month before the area returns to a hairy state.\n\nIts difficult to find a spa or salon that performs this service for guys and to find reviews by guys who've had this service done & are willing to talk about it. Apparently manliness comes into question when one submits to having one's pubes ripped from their body.\n\nAnyhow I first went to Yelp where I was able to get an idea of where to start looking. Ladies are the primary source of information for this service & in the end I spoke with a close friend who works at Re Salon to see if men could get a Brazilian there. As it turned out the service was available for guys & gals. So I booked an appointment & went down to meet my fate.\n\nRe Salon is housed within an old fire house on South Boulevard in front of the Arlington Tower. (The pink glass building.) My specialist was a lady named Elizabeth. The spa part is upstairs but you check in downstairs at a desk on your left. The salon takes up the bottom floor. I was led upstairs and sat in a small waiting area at the top of the stairs. I was quite a bit early for my appointment due to my own nature partly and my nervousness at what would take place. \n\nElizabeth came out & introduced herself & led me to a room where I removed my pants and briefs and lay on my back on a table. I had a towel covering my groin. She talked a bit about the service & what it entailed. Apparently the wax's color, blue, meant that it was a newer formulation making it easier to grab & pull away hair.\nI asked her if she had a lot of male clients and she said she had a few every month. She said that they mainly came in to settle bets of manliness made under alcoholic boasting between friends.\n\nOkay, so what you really want to know is was it painful? Yes its painful. The less hair the less pain, but some areas are going to be painful no matter what the length of the hair is. The nice thing is that Elizabeth makes you feel comfortable & instructs you how to breathe... In through your nose & out through your mouth as the wax is suddenly removed from your body. I would say that 90% of the treatment has a pain level I would peg as annoying. The few times that I actually made an O face the pain was intense but very short lived. The entire service was over and done with in 15 minutes.\n\n I had my waxing in the middle of May and I still don't need another appointment. I think now its been 6 weeks. I think that Re Salon & Spa has a very comfortable atmosphere with wonderful people staffing it. Everyone is friendly & they make you feel at home. The waxing is quick & efficient & Elizabeth is very personable & professional. Definitely ask for her. I'd like to try some of their other services when I get a chance and I'm looking forward to a return visit.", "business_id": "ZECmUkcbwhBwmRn5H38zSw", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-06-28", "type": "review"}

The other actually told me that she was offended I hadn't seen her regularly instead of another and was irritated by every question I had. The ultrasound tech didnt even ask if we wanted to know the gender she just blurted it out, thats fine because we wanted to know but for other families who choose not to i thought that was unprofessional and insensitive, she also always acted like she was upset and annoyed.

To begin back towards the beginning of the month I called them because I was having issues with one of my teeth and wanted a call back to see about any financing or if they could help me out in any way since I'm low income like they have in the past. No response after close to a week, this should have been my first sign, but I called again, they left a voice mail soon after with no real answer to my question, it was basically \"We'll see, maybe, after you see us\". Not really the kind of response I wanted since my concern was finances, what if I went in and they couldn't work with me now?\n\nAnyway I took the chance (once again it is my fault for ignoring the signs) and called them back, made an appointment for a couple of weeks. The night before my appointment I became ill which was keeping me awake as well, so I had no choice but to cancel my appointment. To be fair it was past the normal 24 hr window (I left the message around 12 am because I knew there was no way I was going to feel good enough to go) cancellation I've ever made with them. I called them that morning to make sure they got my message, they did, and that was that. A week later I get a $50 \"no show\" bill sent to me. Which they have every right to do, but doesn't make it good business when you have a loyal customer who always shows up to their appointments, AND referred MULTIPLE people to their location. \n\nI was, of course, upset and did call and leave a message expressing my disappointment and that I was a bit angry about it, but it was a civil message, even if I was clear that I would not pay the $50, that I felt it was a slap in the face, and because of our financial situation I would have no choice but to go somewhere else if it wasn't resolved. That was over a week ago and no response. So much for caring about your customers. If they are willing to lose me as a customer, and maybe future referrals, that is their prerogative but it seems like a bad move to do this over $50. But it seems consistent with my treatment I received with a lack of response prior to the $50 no show (which I didn't even know they had). \n\nHave to give them credit though, they did get my bill of $50 to me faster then any responses to my phone inquiries!\n\nUpdate 6/10\n\nNever heard back from them, but they were once again on time with sending me the same bill.

At that time, I saw Dr Brenda Martin. She was wonderful and very thorough.  I recently scheduled another annual well woman exam. I had to re-schedule due to travel delays out of LA. I called from LA, 6+ hours before my scheduled appointment when I knew my flight into PHX was delayed. When I arrived for my subsequent appointment, I was told I was being charged a $35.00 \"cancellation fee.\" I was also told that since I had re-scheduled an appointment last year, and that $35.00 \"one time cancellation fee\" had been \"waived\", I'd have to speak with the office manager, (who at the time was on vacation.) I asked the young lady at the desk if there were any telephone log notes regarding my recent or last years cancellation. There were not, (she didn't offer to show me anything.) I have the call date & time on my iPhone that shows my recent cancellation/re-schedule. I offered to show this to the employee at the front desk. She kept repeating the \"office policy.\" She was professional and just doing her \"job.\"  I get it.\nHowever.......I too understand the importance of patient scheduling. If I do not see patients, I do not get paid. Time is money. Again, after working as a licensed healthcare professional for 17 years, I get it. Life happens. I have no control over flight cancellations, illness, car wrecks or whatever else may cause a person to call and re-schedule. I always call to re-schedule. The incident causing a re-schedule last year was due to arriving at work at 8am, and by 9am, having to cover additional patients from another therapists caseload as that therapist went home ill. I had immediately called Shea Women's Care to re-schedule that days 3pm appointment as I knew I wouldn't be finished with work. \nToday, I received a call from the office manager of Shea Women's Group that their \"policy\" now requires a $55.00 \"cancellation/re-schedule fee\" as I walked out of the office (last week) when I arrived for my re-scheduled annual well woman exam. \nDid I walk out? Yes. Was I extremely frustrated? Yes. As a cash paying patient, I was being charged a ridiculous amount, and being demanded a \"35.00 cancellation/re-schedule fee.\"  Really?!?  When I called hours ahead of time and re-scheduled?!? I find it amazing that the \"re-schedule fee\" is demanded, yet when a patient sits in the exam room for 30+ minutes AFTER the scheduled appointment time, the patients isn't re-imbursed for their time! Time is money, right?!?\nHealthcare in this country is a greedy train wreck and continues to get worse. I'm sure the healthcare professionals at Shea Women's Care are excellent providers. However, a change in such a ridiculous, unreasonable, rigid policy where everyone is penalized for the rudeness and lack of courtesy of other patients who simply donot show up or call regarding their scheduled appointment is a simpleton act of \"cutting off your nose to spite your face.\"  Very poor business practices. I wish Shea Women's Care continued good luck. I will and am, no longer requiring their services.", "business_id": "UyKNaZFGA3p63UM7esDAsg", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-09-15", "type": "review"}

Be prepared that it is a busy practice and sometimes it takes a few tries to get through via phone. But hey, this is a practice for women and babies about to be born. There are going to be emergencies and delays right? However, everyone in the office knows how to get information. I'm a relatively new paritent and I had an unexpected medical emergency, unrelated to gyn issues - blood clot in leg.  Dr. Swainston called me at UMC, a hospital where he does not have privileges, to check on me. He brought me in after I was released to make sure that my gyn care matched my needs in terms of the clot medication.\nHe's incredibly kind and honest and easy to talk to because he is a listener.  Most importantly, he is talented and knowledgable,  A friend had a complicated pregnacy recently and Dr. Swainston ahd his associate took over her care. The job they did was amazing.  Mother and baby are beautiful and healthy.\nLadies, I don't care that sending you here will make the office even busier, you must go to this doctor!", "business_id": "wqujbV-b_Pu-wzJp4mlteA", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-12-27", "type": "review"}

Dr. Drewitz  (and a few others) got pretty awesome reviews elsewhere online and was a peer-voted TOP DOC in the Phoenix Magazine. While that's not the patients voting, Yelpers, I suggest you do your own research. \n\nNote: I will update my review if I need to go back.\n\nNow to my experience. I called with digestive stress thinking it was a pretty serious episode that I was having. They got me in quickly but with a young doctor that hadn't received very good online reviews. They were quick to assign this one to me and although i was leery, I decided to just give this guy the benefit of the doubt.\n\nAs another Yelper just before me mentioned, although I don't know if we had the same doc, the bedside manner was virtually non-existent. While he may just have a laid back personality, professionally, I prefer my docs to act like they give a shit.\n\nSo then after asking me a few perfunctory questions about my current symptoms, he does the \"stethoscope to the heart and back\" routine and sends me to a kind woman to schedule my CT scan at a local Imaging place. Again, they got me in pretty quickly.\n\nHere's where it went awry for me. I went in for the scan on a Friday and the CT techs said the drs. office would receive results in 2 to 3 bus. days. I called Digestive Health Center - Coronado in 4. They had the results but the dr. had to sign off so someone could tell me my results and hadn't. Meanwhile, I'm beginning to panic cause NO NEWS IS BAD NEWS when you're a patient with a condition.\n\nEIGHT BUSINESS DAYS LATER, I call back like WTF? The assistant was apologetic but noted he STILL hadn't signed off on my results. Now remember , that this is simply so they can tell me something IS or ISNT wrong with me. Jeez!!!!!\n\nSo I said I need another doctor then. An hour or two later another doctor calls back to tell me all is fine. For this frustrating episode, I receive a dang near $200 bill (after insurance pays their part and note how quickly THAT arrived vs. how slow the follow up was) and after paying $350 out of pocket for a CT scan. So $550 of my hard-earned- and- not- easily- come- by savings later, I am ok but seriously do not feel the service I received was worth it!", "business_id": "QC3osgPdEl_TEZA2CtNeQw", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-12-01", "type": "review"}

She spent half of this time trying to discuss why I'm not on birth control. It's obvious she hasn't ever reviewed my files. Ugh!! She refused to give me a prescription for my infection until I I took an x-ray and said she would call me that evening with the results. Of course I had the x-ray taken right away. Thank goodness I didn't hold my breathe! The technician even stated that I my doctor should have prescribed me something for an infection. I never received a call back despite leaving messages with the secretary. Communication is horrible, both with patients and other medial facilities.

One, doctors scare me. They make me feel all insecure assuming that they scold you for not properly taking care of your health if something is wrong with you, and I hate being scolded. Two, the wait I'd always so long and I feel like you are just one of the hundreds of people they tend to on a daily basis so I feel like I am just another patient. Three, doctor bills give me heart attacks. If I could sow my arm back into place if I could I would just to avoid the doctors, but I'm sure my doctor wouldn't approve of that.\n\nDr. Jimenez was recommended by a family friend so when I had to go to a doctor I thought I'd give him a try. If a trustworthy person says he's cool then I'll pray he is. A long wait was unavoidable so I did have to wait a few hours being that I was a walk in. The nursing assistants are so friendly and chipper! Being that it is a family practice center I guess I shouldn't doubt that seeing as though they're not all frantic with caring for a whole bunch of people. They made me feel at ease and comfortable there, and from the looks of it, the staff seems like theyre all just one big happy family. It is a really small waiting room but it makes up for the big flat screen that plays good movies (I got to watch the whole RED movie which I was glad for because I never get to finish it). When it was finally time for me to get checked up the nursing assistant was very friendly and nice she even let my mom take her blood pressure and weight herself for fun. Then dr. Jimenez walked Into the room with his million dollar smile and his pimped out leather weaved loafers and matching button up. He was very perky, and asked me questions in a friendly manner. Then quickly diagnosed me and made sure I come back for a check up. He didn't tell me in a stern way to where I felt awful and pressured. It was more like he was concerned and wanted to make sure my health was up to par. I'd definitely recommend him. This place just makes you feel comfortable being in a doctors office.

I'm glad I don't live in town and run the risk of ever having to go there again.\n\nSECURITY:\nFirst and foremost, their security is beyond a joke.  I'm in town for a business conference/meeting when I am experiencing the familiar symptoms, tthat I know are life threatening.  As I walk into the ER, I am looking directly at the Triage nurses, who are waiting for me to come up to the window.  About 10 feet before I reach them, a security guard literally yells at me, asking me what I wanted.  I just looked at him and asked him if he was really seriious?   In a tone, I made it clear, he would be calling a lot of back up if he didn't stfu.   His response was..\"ohh ok if you want to be seen, wait behind the black line for the nurses to call you\".  These are the nurses, who are obviously waiting for me to come up to their window and talk to them.  (There was one other person in the entire waiting room!!)  So after explaining the situation to the nurses, they call an emergency code to come get me.  \n\nWhile in the \"serious\" section of the ER, where they put their major trauma, heart attack, stroke etc. patients. I see a German Shepard with his handler walk through.  I'm thinking it was a police officer who was their with a prisoner and didn't want to leave the dog in the car as the heat could be very dangerous.  But I find out that this is the security's dog patrolling to keep things in check.  Very weird to see this.  But to bring the dog into the section where people are on the verge of dying it completely friggin insulting.\n\nSo when I am making small talk with the staff, it becomes clear that EVERYONE has had a run in with security. One of many stories I heard, was how a nurse in her scrubs, with her photo ID hanging around her neck was stopped and questioned as to what she was doing in the hospital.\n\nDOCTOR'S\nThe ER doc was compentent. Though he really seemed to be botherd, because I had questions. I already knew the diagnosis (I made it before I came in), but when he told me of the CT scan results, it implied that I was going to lose my leg.  So I of couse I had questions.  One was were the radiologists good enough to understand what they were seeing?\nHe assured me they were very good.  The  radiologist was ultimately determined to be a dumbass.  But because of his incorrect reading of the 4 CT scans, I was just about to get out of there and drive the several hours home.  Which, really could have killed me.  D**** (for her protection), one awesome nurse, convinced me to stay because she didn't think what the doctor's were telling me, was correct and she told me WHY she felt that way.  And she was absolutlely right.  So the admitting physician/hospitalist put me on a no food or drink order as he expected me to have a surgical procedure, done first thing in the morning, to try to correct the misdiagnosed CT scans.\n\nThe next day, about 11am he rounds and I ask him about why the surgical procedure that hasn't happened yet.  And he tells me that the surgeon is reviewing my case and still hasn't decided if I was a candidate for the procedure. So around 2pm the surgeon/specialist rounds and sees me.  I ask him what is going on with the procedure.  He informs me that he made it very clear that morning to the hospitalist, that I wasn't a candidate.  So I waited 20 hours without even water and the hospitalist knew it, and made me wait even longer.  Not cool at all.  \n\nNow the surgeon/specialist was very good.  He brought up some ideas and thoughts that I could share with my specialists back home.\n\nSo it was clear that I had all the meds I needed and could go home that day, but we had to get the orders from the hospitalist.  Problem was, is that my sister would have to fly out to get me and drive me home. So she needed to make sure they would release me.  Repeated messages and pages to the hospitalist go unreturned.  This is becoming a major logistical problem.  So my nurse Linda (probably one of the best nurses I ever had) tells me to tell my sister to get on the plane becuase she will make my discharge happen.  She does, and I finally get the hell out of there.\n\nNURSES:  Other than a nurse who doesn't understand HIPPA regulations. They were all very good and the only redeeming factor for this hospital.  D*** kept me there and potentially saved my life.  Then AFTER she was off her shift she went out of her way to go to my car and get my bags which had several things I needed if I was going to stay. Now,  Linda was like a mom.  She took care of me, bitched to me about some of the things I shouldn't be doing, forced the doctor's to do their job and made the whole experience so much better. \n\nBILLING AND POST HOSPITALIZATION FAILURES:\nThey totally screw up the billing, say they will fix it, and don't.

I really should've read the reviews on yelp before I purchased my groupon from this place. \nAnyway, I bought a groupon offer for xray,exam&regular cleaning combo for this dentistry. Reason? For my regular half an year check up & cleaning. Plus I don't have insurance so that's the only reason this time I went for a groupon. Ok let's start the story. I went there this morning, waited 25 mins then had a x-Ray taken by a young girl, then a doctor came and told me I had some kinda gum disease and 5 cavities. I was very shocked cuz I do go to my dentist every half a year. And actually a little over 7 months ago I even got my regular teeth cleaning & whitening done. My dentist told me Last time all l need to do is do a lily take more flossing, other than that my teeth were looking good! Half a year later, my teeth really got some kind of serious problem and gum diseases? Ok.. Another 30 mins later this young girl finally came back with an estimate for $1724 for my \"deep cleaning\" for next two visits. And also a credit plan. I remember when I had my gum bleeding a few years ago I had to get a deep cleaning and it was less than $600 at a dentistry in Chandler. So I told her it's ok I'll just do my regular cleaning. Ok put back in the waiting area again. 15 mins later, told me I'm free to go. Really? I asked what about my cleaning? I paid the offer on groupon. She said they can't do a regular cleaning for me because I need a deep cleaning. I have the estimate and it's optional. I repeated one more time that I paid the offer and it does include the regular cleaning. Ok now she says \" you have to talk to groupon then, we don't promise to clean your teeth when your teeth need something more. I have other patients and I don't have time..\" \nWow of course I walked away, being very angry. Paid the money for cleaning and got nothing except all this BS.

When I asked what was this money for, my insurance covers the exam, he told me it was for the contacts I just ordered. I don't know how he jumped from me saying I didn't like the pair to me ordering a year supply!!!  Luckily, he cancelled the order. \n\nThe entire process of trying on different contacts and then getting my prescription number was a horrible experience. I received push back on every phone call Robert even argued with me and belittled me on the phone instead of answering my questions. Each time I called (because they never called back when they said they would), the new person I spoke to said there were no notes or mention about my phone call and request.\n\nDon't waste your time with these clowns and go to a more sophisticated optical center where they treat you with respect.", "business_id": "aVETs4peva3q3j4lRnHGEw", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-04-08", "type": "review"}

(Of course, this is not to be confused with the service also known as body shampoos found at places with questionable intentions.)\n\nWhen inquiring about this service, we were led passed the chairs reserved for foot massages and into the back room.  This room had three massage beds with sinks specifically built attached to them.  The Husband and I then had our shoulders covered with a towel and plastic to prevent those areas from getting wet and we laid down with our heads over the sink.  This is where the similarities ended.\n\nThe person I had was Mark.  I have long hair.  He started to massage my scalp for a little while before turning the water on to wet my hair.  He then shampooed my hair and spent a considerable amount of time 'scratching' my scalp.  This is something that can be enjoyable and quite relaxing depending on the person and the circumstance, but it was just okay this time.  He then also did some cranial pressure before rinsing my hair of the shampoo and applying conditioner.  He made a point of making sure my hair was completely conditioned as he ran a comb through it all.  And then he rinsed all the conditioner out and squeezed some of the water out of my hair.  I was then instructed to get up so we could walk to a smaller room where he would blow dry my hair.  He then dried my hair and ran a brush through it to get rid of any tangles.  And then I was done.  Unfortunately, my hair was still a bit damp and the bottom half of my shirt in the back was all wet from the walk from the sink to the blow drying room.  (Perhaps he could have wrapped my hair in a towel to prevent that from happening.)  He apologized for the wet shirt part but I had to go blow dry my shirt as a result.  \n\n3 stars.\n\nMeanwhile, the Husband has practically no hair and he had Reao.  He said he didn't get that much scratching, but more pressure on his scalp, face, and shoulders.  While I was getting my hair blow dried, he was still getting cranial work done.  He felt so relaxed that he almost fell asleep.  He tried to inquire about what other services would take place if we had chosen the 60 minute option, but Reao did not quite understand him.  She thought he was trying to extend his experience to the 60 minute one.  He wanted to know if they were going to focus more on the scalp, shoulders, or face.  He really enjoyed it and would do it again.  \n\n4.5 stars from him.\n\nI think I lost out on the experience because: \n\na) I had a guy.  (And unfortunately I believe he smelled of cigarette smoke.  So with my sensitive sense of smell, and him running his hands through my hair, it was distracting.)  \n\nb) I have long hair.  Because so much time was spent shampooing, conditioning, and blow drying, there was less time for cranial work. Yes, I know it's called a head shampoo but you know you're really there for good cranial work.  It's almost like a glorified hair shampooing experience at your local salon.  \n\nOverall, I think if you're a bald guy, you may just love it.  Half the experience at a hair salon is getting your head shampooed and massaged and this place focuses on that part.  Unfortunately, I just didn't get that many head tingles from the experience like I was hoping for!  Would I go back?  Maybe - if I cut my hair and/or if I get a girl next time.  Some girls just know how to massage the scalp better, maybe it's the nail thing? \n\n30 minutes = $25\n60 minutes = $48\n60 minutes combo = $45 (30 minute head shampoo and 30 minute reflexology)\n\nThey are located exactly next door to Ichiza.

The company stopped making Tetracycline and there has literally been none made since June 2011 (See Link: http://www.ashp.org/DrugShortages/Current/bulletin.aspx?id=816 )\n\nRemember they gave me the prescription in December 2011, about 1/2 a year since Tetracycline was being made but that is another issue.  I was able to get the first few months of the prescription filled with some assistance of a very helpful pharmacist but she could no long locate any left over supplies of Tetracycline after March of so of 2012.\n\nI was able to go until about mid October 2012 with what Tetracycline I had on hand.  My prescription is good for this until Dec 31, 2012 or about two months and change.\n\nSo I could get two more 30 day supplies on the prescription before my prescription runs out.\n\nHere is the KICKER and why I WILL NOT BE GO BACK TO English Dermatology Center, when I called and explained the situation about Tetracycline not being made anymore and I need to have the remainder of my prescription changed to an equivalent prescription, they said they would NOT be able to do the change to the prescription because Mindy (the Physician Assistant) doesn't renew prescriptions if they haven't seen you in the last 12 months.\n\nI explained that I was there about 10 months ago and there was total silence on the phone.  They said they would have to call me back.  They then called and said that they would only renew the prescription until December 4, 2012 (one year exactly to the day) and I would have to come in and PAY ANOTHER MEDICAL APPOINTMENT FEE to get my prescription renewed through the last 26 days of December 2012.\n\nRemember I'm just trying to get the original prescription, thru Dec. 31, 2012, changed to something that is actually being made and actually available but all English Dermatology Center wants to do is get me in the door for ANOTHER BILLABLE APPOINTMENT.\n\nEnglish Dermatology Center IS WHAT IS WRONG WITH OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM.  English Dermatology Center can't keep their word and give me the prescription equivalent for the same time, December 31, 2012, they authorized previously because they just want to FORCE YOU TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT AND TAKE YOUR MONEY!\n\nDon't think that because you have insurance that your and I are not paying for it.   English Dermatology Center's process and forced appointment practices are exactly why the cost of Employer-Sponsored health insurance premiums have more than doubled in the last 9 years, a rate 3 times faster than cumulative wage increases.\n\nDo yourself and your family a favor and, if you use English Dermatology Center, FIND A DIFFERENT DERMATOLOGIST or if you are looking for a dermatologist, definitely DO NOT USE English Dermatology Center.", "business_id": "usloqnO8zBW8m1s9q9TT0Q", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-10-24", "type": "review"}

He asked what my previous birth control prescription was, and although I told him those pills gave me horrible migraines, he still prescribed them to me.\n\nThree weeks after my appointment, I've had 6 migraines and it hadn't been a whole month. So I called back and asked if I could have a consultation with my doctor. \n\nAn appointment was scheduled, and this time I had a different doctor. I told my lady doctor about my migraines and she told me to stop taking my current prescription. Then she asked asked me, \"What do you think we should do?\" I was appalled! Aren't YOU the doctor?? You should know what to do.. But I kept my cool and we talked about other birth control methods.\n\nWe came to a agreement on another pill prescription, which I am currently taking, but these pills are \"active\" pills. The whole reason I came to this facility, was to have something that could keep me regular.. I am very disappointed and I have scheduled another appointment for a day this week. \n\nA whole month now and I still don't have a prescription that fits me and my body..", "business_id": "IEphF3pqmpxMK5hUevGsZA", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-06-26", "type": "review"}

I rarely go to the doctor but have had regular visits with my OB during my pregnancy and he requested that I receive a vaccine from my PCP... I complied and made the appointment with the last office I had been to, Hatfield. \n\nWhen I called to schedule the appointment the girl that I spoke to on the phone was VERY rude, short and seemed to be talking to someone else in the background about something unrelated to my phone call. I gave her all of my insurance information (ID numbers and such) and set a date. I then asked her if my vaccine would be covered by my insurance policy and she bluntly told me that it was my job to find that out, not hers. Fine. \n\nOn the day of my appointment I arrived 10 minutes early, and signed in. There were 3 women at the desk when I arrived and not one of them greeted or even acknowledged me upon arrival. I gave them my insurance card and photo id when they finally got to me (I was the ONLY one in the waiting room at the time) and was then told, with a snotty attitude, that I needed to call my insurance and have their doctor added to my list as I had been assigned to another doctor. Again, Fine. \nI don't mind making a phone call, that I can only assume could have been done LONG before my appointment time, if someone would have had the decency to ask me to do so. They could have easily asked me to make the call prior to my appointment instead of snapping at me in the waiting room 5 minutes prior to my appointment because it wasn't done. (I should also mention that I am new to this insurance plan and had NO IDEA that I was even assigned to a doctor, let alone a doctor that wasn't theirs!!) \n\nMy appointment was in the very early morning, so I partially understand the lack of enthusiasm in the office, but after dealing with the front office staff I am fully convinced that their bad attitude is probably an all day type of thing. I was hoping that I could voice my concern to the doctor, but he too was rushed and seemed inconvenienced by my appointment. After seeing the doctor and receiving the ONE vaccine that I had to go through all this trouble for, I was then left to exit the office on my own and was, again, not acknowledged on my way out, even after stopping at the counter to make sure no co-pay was due. \n\nI work in the medical field and can tell you first hand that staff like this in any other office would be terminated...

My teeth were spotless and whiter and brighter than ever. After just one visit, I am sold. I can't speak highly enough about my experience at Serene Dental. I created this Yelp account because my experience was so overwhelmingly positive that I feel Dr. Hangalay's office deserves more feedback on this website. It's common knowledge that good dentists can be hard to find these days as mediocrity, lack of integrity, and/or carelessness seem to be closer to the norm. My experience at this office was refreshing.\n\nScheduling of appointment: Effortless. I requested an appointment on short notice (dental insurance was expiring soon) and they were able to squeeze me in. \n\nOffice location: Serene Dental is well located in Central Phoenix not far from the Biltmore/Town and Country Shopping Center. Centrally located in the valley. \n\nOffice Appearance/Lobby: Spacious lobby/front desk, complimentary bottled water.  Upscale and clean office. But if you need a fish tank in the lobby (lol) go elsewhere. \n\nStaff: Ok, now we're getting somewhere. This is where Serene Dental shines. Griselda the front desk employee was friendly and thorough about the insurance/billing. There was some uncertainty on whether my insurance would cover the initial x-ray exam so they decided to provide the x-rays at no charge. Very nice courtesy that left a good impression on me. The other staff member I dealt with, Courtney, was also pleasant. You know I almost never remember the names of the support staff/hygienists at offices I visit... so that probably says something right there. Or maybe because I was at Dr. Hangalay's office for nearly 3 hours total hmmm. But it wasn't spent waiting in the lobby, it was the x-rays, thorough cleaning, various questions answered, and the hour-long teeth whitening session.  I'd also disregard the sole negative review below. Griselda was nothing but nice and professional. I suspect this was a case of a discrepancy between the amount the insurance company was believed to cover versus what they actually covered. If that the case, it's not fair to blame that on Dr. Hangalay's office. Dental insurance is a headache and unless something is pre-authorized it can be difficult to know how much is covered for larger procedures. It's dependent on the insurance company. Anyways, the staff here is great!\n\nDentist herself: Friendly and thorough. No up-sell. I inquired about perhaps getting more work done at her office and she said \"you don't need it\".  I asked again about something else and she again replies \"you don't need it\". Very honest and seems to have her patients best interests in mind... which is sadly something not so evident with many dentists here in the good ole' USA. I am always skeptical about new dentists, but Serene Dental put me at ease instantly. I felt like I was in good hands the entire time and could tell the cleaning was very thorough. Also I'd like to note, Dr. Hangalay does most of the cleaning herself. I've been to a few other offices where the hygienist does all the work and the dentist comes in and looks around my mouth for 30 seconds to 1 minute and says \"your teeth look good\" and then leaves. It's like why am I even seeing a dentist? Serene Dental does not operate like this. I've also ran into Dr. Hangalay a couple times in Central Phoenix and she's just as friendly outside the office. \n\nTeeth whitening: This was so good, I needed to touch on it. If you visit her office, consider getting the Venus Teeth Whitening.  I never had teeth whitening done (Crest white-strips don't count) and am so glad I did. They had a special discount price on the Venus Whitening and I took advantage of it. As soon as I left her office, my teeth were noticeably whiter and here about 3 weeks later they still look great. I was told the results should last many months. The whitening takes about an hour but is totally worth it. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this. Not sure what the regular price is, but if they are running a discount it's a no-brainer. Even at regular price it's probably a sound investment. As I said, the results were drastic for me. \n\nConclusion: If you are in need of a dentist in Phoenix, look no further than Serene Dental. Or at least give this place a shot and hopefully your experience will mirror mine. As long as I'm a Phoenix resident, Serene Dental will be my spot for any dental work.", "business_id": "K2Q48mYfJ6a1kCQyx752fg", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-12-13", "type": "review"}

My usual place is Ocean Reflexology.  I saw the great reviews and the Yelp special for Magnolia, so I thought I would give them a shot.  From my experience today, this place can't hold a candle to the service at Ocean.    \n     I made an appointment for 2 P.M.  When I arrived, a few people were trying to pay, so I just stepped back.  After they left, nobody addressed me, so I went up to them and said that I had a 2 P.M. appointment for a Yelp special.  Someone brought me to a room and then left.  I stripped down to my underwear and sat...for ten minutes.  People walked by, but nobody said that they would be with me in a minute or anything like that.  One man (I think the owner or manager) looked in my room...and then walked away.  If they were too busy to take me, they could have had me wait in the waiting room.  As a side note--there are no curtains for the rooms.  I thought I read that there were curtains.  I didn't see any on any of the rooms.\n     When the massage therapist arrived, he just said \"Hi\" and then started getting things ready.  The massage was just okay.  The pressure on the head, neck, and shoulders was not very strong and he used very slow strokes.  At Ocean, they move much faster and use various techniques--that's what I prefer.  He was much stronger with my back.  My only issue with his back work was that he mostly used the same stroke over and over again.   For the hot stone treatment, he just held two hot rocks and rubbed them up and down my back quickly.  I lasted about two minutes.  I've never had that treatment before, so I really didn't know what to expect--I guess I was just expecting a little more.\n     When I went to pay, the woman at the register said that is was $28.  I gave her two twenties.  She said, \"Do you want the rest for the therapist\"  She might have called him something else, but that was the meaning.  I didn't like that she assumed that I was going to leave him a $12 tip for a $28 service.  In all honesty, I had planned on giving the therapist the $12, but he was late, left me sitting in the room in my underwear for ten minutes, and just gave a so-so massage.  I told her that I was leaving him $7.  She then gave me two singles and a ten dollar bill, trying to force me to give him a $12 tip.  I asked her to give me two fives for the ten.  She then said that most people give at least ten dollars for a 60 minute massage.  I gave the man the seven and told her thank you.  Then I asked if I could have a card.  She gave me a card.  I said, \"Can I get a stamp on it?\"  She then stamped it and said nothing.  Although when she spoke earlier, she sounded pleasant, I got the feeling that I was not welcome in their establishment, even though I was never rude or crabby with any of the workers.  So...live and learn.  Maybe I just had a bad experience there.  There are a lot of positive reviews for this place, so maybe I just caught them on a bad day.  Anyway, I only give my business to places that seem welcoming, so I will not be returning to Magnolia.  At Ocean Reflexology, they treat me very well and always do top-notch work. I will continue to give them my business because they earn it.", "business_id": "0w3SqrrhkxB_7t0Vhr6tQQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-12-20", "type": "review"}

He addressed the number one reason why people don't visit the dentist and that reason was mostly due to PST and that every horrible situation is felt when a patient sits in the Dentist's chair. I knew that this man knew what he was talking about and he understood how I felt. I'd have panic attacks, even at the thought of going to the dentist. I told him about my situation and he was very kind and invited me to his office to meet his staff and just talk. No exam, no charge, just talk about my concerns etc. \nWhen I walked into the office, it was not what I had expected at all. I didn't feel like I was in a medical office, it didn't even smell like a doctor's office. It was calm, and quiet and pleasant and after having a nice chat with Dr. Stokes and his staff I felt confident that I would be able to let the Doctor look at my teeth. It was painless...he communicated with me, always making sure I was comfortable, I at no time felt that I was just a head of teeth in a chair, but more like a member of the family. \nIf affordability is an issue he has several options to help. Lacey is wonderful at working with you when it comes to costs and affording care.\nI have been now going to Dr. Stokes for well over 3 years. A couple of months ago the Doctor offered me a great opportunity and I have just recently been fortunate to try a new product offered by Lumineers called Durathin on my teeth. This has corrected the chips, stains and misshaped teeth and I have a beautiful perfect smile. This particular product is much thinner than the old Veneers you hear about. There is very little and I mean very little prep work involved and no pain whatsoever. I am so happy and satisfied with the way my teeth look, that I wish I had done this years ago. What I thought I wouldn't be able to tolerate, or afford is all but a misguided fear that is now gone. I'll never be afraid to deal with any dental issues now that I have found Dr. Stokes and the Staff at Eastern Canyon Dental. I cannot say enough positive things about these people. If you would have told me 3 years ago I wouldn't be afraid to go to the dentist I'd have said they were crazy. I would recommend anyone, especially those who are looking for a Dentist who truly cares about his patients and makes you feel like one of the family you must see Dr. Joel Stokes you will be treated just as wonderful and amazing as I was. Much love and thanks again to Dr. Stokes, Lacey, Lily, Deanna, Laura, and Joely from the bottom of my heart I can't stop smiling!

It took me 2 state universities, two community colleges and one private college to earn my Bachelors and Master's degrees. The good news is I still managed to finish in 6 years. Then I decided to attend SWIHA.\n\nTechnically I suppose you could call SWIHA a private/vocational school. However, anyone who has ever taken a class here will tell you it's much more. This place is incredible for many reasons. \n\nWhen you walk into the doors of this place, the feel here is so calm and welcoming. If you're coming for a message or going to SWINA (separate building) for spa services you won't be sorry. For message, pay the cheaper price and go with a student. I have yet to be disappointed. There are so many modalities here, some you probably haven't even heard of. In addition to message they also offer clinics in hypnotherapy, reiki, polarity and other holistic healing methods. So call the student clinic and ask. Some things are free the first time you come in (not massage though). Oh and as an added bonus if you are a student here, you get your massage by a student practitioner at half price. Comes out to $15 bucks or so.\n\n\nOk now let's say you want to go to school here. You meet with an admissions counselor and then an advisor. These are some of the nicest people I've ever met in a college. They really do care about what you want and are here to help you acheive your goals. The whole school is geared towards this. They even have awesome job placement people for when you graduate.\n\nThe programs here are numerous and in many ways all intertwined. You will be in classes with people from all different backgrounds and lifestyles. Everyone will be approaching health from a holistic perspective, each with their own special talents. The teachers here are incredible. Honestly, I've had some great professors in all of my education but there is something different about the teachers here. They also seem to have a lot of input in creating the actual classes which makes each class very dynamic and unique. Some of them create events and groups as well. Students are also able to do the actual work while still going to school to learn more and more.\n\nImagine going to a school where people remember your name. Picture going to a place where you can actually grow, heal, learn and are encouraged to think outside the box. If you want a place where you will be guided through an incredible process that often leads to great success then come check out SWIHA. You won't be disappointed.\n\nOh and the other day some one asked me if this was a school mostly for women. While they seem to be the majority, there are still quite a few of us guys there...and male teachers too.", "business_id": "q-afVl9efsqT3HhnkGGP8g", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-05-06", "type": "review"}

They tell you one thing, but found out that's wrong. When you're dealing with someone's heart situation, it's scary and the staff should make it easier for you. \n\nDr. Chanderraj doesn't have a great bedside manner. After he ordered my stress test, he still wasn't satisfied with those results, so I was told I needed to get an angiogram. He told me that he wasn't going to do it, but that an associate of his would be doing it. His office staff said that they would be calling me to schedule the procedure. Once the date was set, Dr. Chanderraj's office said that they would call to go over what medications that I could and could not take before the procedure. I was also told that the hospital would call me two days before the procedure to register me over the phone. \"Great!\" I thought. Not great it turns out. When the office contacted me to go over the meds and arrival time I missed the call and they left a long message. I tried to call right back, but it was a Friday at 6:30pm and it was a three day weekend. When I did get a hold of them Tuesday morning I had to leave a message. When the nurse called me back she was incredibly rude and had the tone of voice that I was bothering her with my silly questions. \n\nThe Thursday before my angiogram I still had heard nothing from the hospital. So again I called Dr. Chanderraj's office and asked if I was doing everything I need to be doing before the next day's procedure. They informed me that on the original message they should have told me I needed to go to the hospital prior and register plus do blood work before 3:30pm that day. Two hours later the hospital called not to register me, but to go over meds again. They also were nice enough to tell me I had till 4:30pm to register that day. Needless to say once we got to the hospital we were hit with an extremely large bill that I had to pay at that time or be forced to reschedule the whole thing. Apparently the doctors office was supposed to inform me of this bill prior to everything. \n\nIf I had a choice of going to somewhere else I totally would have, but Nevada Heart is the only place my insurance covers.

It was a great experience and at only $30 for the 60 minutes it's so inexpensive. There's no reason not to give your feet a treat.

The facility is new, bright, and most importantly feels very clean and has modern technology. Dr. Lam was so nice and never made me feel like I was taking (and failing) an exam. She explained everything and I feel very confident in her ability to spot and diagnose problems. Chris was also very nice, taking the time to help me pick out frames and made great suggestions based on things I liked. I love that I can schedule my appointment online and fill out my patient form ahead of time, making the process to go in and get out very efficient. Chris also made sure I knew what my coverage was for the exam based on my insurance ahead of time, which I appreciated very much. When I went back in to pick up my glasses, they greeted me by name and were so friendly and helpful, and even included a little treat. Eye Care North definitely defines what great customer service is.\n\nThe only thing that I had a hard time with was understanding the cost of my glasses, and I'm sure this is half due to insurance companies being hard to understand. VSP states typical co-pays on their website for all the different \"add ons\" like polarized, polymer, UV protection, etc. but Eye Care North groups it all together into various packages that include \"free UV protection, scratch resistance, etc.\". I ended up being really confused on what I needed and why it all ended up costing so much, which is partly due to my own lack of research but also partly due to the fact that Eye Care North groups it all together into lens packages without a breakdown. So I recommend people new to needing glasses to do some research ahead of time on what you really need and then come in prepared to be shocked at how much lenses cost even with insurance :)", "business_id": "JGUqJWpQnM003_p6qCWurg", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-10-07", "type": "review"}

Once Dr Shore looked at it she said it should heal. She said if it didn't get better with in couple days to come back to see her. After leaving the office I thought to myself why didn't she just give the antibiotic. I figured shit, she's a Dr so she must know better then me, right?  \n\nA couple days went by and it appeared worse and definitely not better. So I went back to the Dr Office and they asked me to pay another $20.00 co-pay. I argued with the  office manager over it saying why should I pay you another co-pay when the Dr said to come back if it wasn't getting better!? Its for the same problem. The office manager just said because my insurance requires a co-pay. I asked her if I was having stitches removed would you require another co-pay? She said no that's different. I said its for the same problem and were talking 3 days! I then explained to the manager that all I need is an antibiotic, so can you just ask the Dr to call in a perscription for me? She said just a minute and went to talk to Dr Shore. She came back and said no, she has to see you. So I really had no choice but to pay the $20.00 co-pay but asked if she could bill me for it and she said NO. So I paid the co-pay and was seen again by Dr Shore. \n\nI was in the room for like 1-2 minutes before she says yes you need an antibiotic. I said to myself, NO SHIT LADY! I TRIED TO TELL YOU ALL THAT! Obviously they just wanted to make more money off my insurance and myself. So as I walked out of the room Dr Shore apologized for having to see me again. I sincerely believe It was superficial and I said to Dr Shore and the office Manager, \"For twenty dollars you just lost a patient and earned a bad review.\" They didn't say anything. You would think they would say something. I mean if I ran an office or was the owner etc the last thing I would want is a negative review or an unhappy client. I would at least talk with them and try and resolve it. \n\nBottom line is that office is out to make the money not caring about their patients. I have nothing bad to say about Dr Kwon as I have seen him approximately 2 times total. He was very knowledgeable and nice. However it is his office and if that's how he chooses to run it and allow his staff and Dr Shore to lie and deceive patients then he is just as bad. I will never go there again. If I had read a review like Jeff T. prior then I never would have even gone to that office in the first place. I do wonder if Dr Kwon even knows whats going on in his own office or maybe he just doesn't care and is like all of them.

Too lazy and inconsistent to have a regular general practitioner but the immune system of a geriatric. Moving on; I had been feeling like crap for about a week (Read review on Basil Thai), and so I used the \"Find a provider\" tool offered by my health insurance. It found 3 doctors in a 10 mile radius of the doctor; I called all 3; all 3 are \"not taking new patients.\" 1 star to the Blue Cross Blue Shield Find a provider website. \n\nI found this place when i google mapped \"urgent care.\" I drove there and pulled right into a spot. I walked in wet from the rain, sick from something, and all around miserable. This place was very welcoming. The front desk girl treated me very well; and she didn't make me feel like I was doing her a favor for being there (take that Thousand Oaks Urgent Care). The doctor himself was pretty typical; in an out of the room in under 5 minutes. He wrote me a prescription for antibiotics and sent me off. All in all; I was there for about an hour but it was during lunch. \n\nI would recommend this place if you are looking for a quick visit without an appointment. They also called the next day to follow up; which is why they get the 4th star :)", "business_id": "bsuPftbPn4nwvYe79mk-jQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-10-29", "type": "review"}

I yelped this place like I do before I go just about anywhere.  My Mom had a gift card for here from someone and didn't want it, so she said I could use it during my quick visit home.  Solid 4.5 star rating.  I've had a reflexology massage before.  No problem, thanks, Mom!\n\nI'm pretty open-minded, but I could NOT get into this place.  It's all one big open room with like half walls separating massage areas.  A nice lady comes in to do her thing, and she was sweet and did an alright job.  But I couldn't chill cause you hear all the slapping from everyone else, people coming and going, side conversations... But okay fine, this is technically a free massage afterall, so, fine.  Then she covers my eyes, and continues to work.  And when the towel was removed from my eyes, a GUY had been massaging me!  I have no idea when they switched!  I don't care that a guy was doing it, but it was a shock to suddenly see a different face.  \n\nThen I'm told to lay face down.  Mr. Massager starts going off on me like I'm his punching bag.  I'm wondering what I ever did to this guy to deserve this beating.  But I tell myself, Okay maybe it's toxins leaving my system or whatever, maybe I should expect some discomfort, and I tough it out.  BUT THEN.  Homeboy gets a candy out of this dish that's sitting on this little table and proceeds to roll it around in his mouth and suck on it and slobber all over it for the remainder of my treatment.  SO GROSS.  And he's rubbing all deep and somehow manages to basically lay his junk all over my head while he's doing it.  I'm half laughing and half totally embarrassed and disgusted to even type that!  UGHGHHH!  There was zero communication, he pulls up my shirt and unhooks my BRA and I'm thinking, DID I YELP THE CORRECT PLACE???  (For the record, yes, I did yelp the correct place).  DO PEOPLE REALLY LIKE THIS??  IS THIS HOW IT'S DONE??  WHEN IS THIS GOING TO BE OVER??? WHO GAVE MY MOM THIS GIFTCARD ANYWAY???  WHAT AM I DOING HERE AND WHERE IS THE NEAREST EXIT?? Good thing I went in and my Mom didn't, she would have probably killed somebody.  There's my good deed for the day... sacrificing the worst hour of my week so my Mom didn't have to suffer through it instead.

Well I can bet from a guys perspective it is completely different from that of a woman that is preparing to give birth.  When we found out we had our second child was on the way the first things that I started thinking about were things like, oh no, I'm going to have to change diapers again, a slow medley also started playing in my mind while I was kissing the thought of sleep goodbye and all of this while my wife was starting to research her birthing options and making phone calls to check on what she called \"The Important Stuff\".  To me, making sure we had our closet stuffed with diaper genie refills was \"Important Stuff\", come to find out, making the correct decision about where or who is going to deliver your newborn is a little higher on the importance meter. \nWe had a midwife as our provider with our first child but it was set in the hospital environment and seemed no different than having a standard doctor handling things, and since this was our first child what seemed like 490 Glucose tests and all these other tests that they kept requesting my wife go through all came off as a normal procedures and I had nothing to question. That is until we met Allyson. \nI came home from work and Becky had mentioned that we were going to meet with a potential midwife and she had settled on the idea of having a home birth.  Okay, this is where the differences shine. She was all engines go and I was riding the brakes, even though I knew we had a very normal uneventful birth with our daughter the thought of something happening just kept lingering in my mind and then the more pity things like, umm well who is going to clean everything up and can I watch TV in the warmed birthing pool prior to the delivery?? What guys doesn't want a hot tub in the living room. \nAfter meeting with Allyson we walked out of well-rounded momma and got in the car and both said at that moment that we have found the right person. From that point forward every thing went great, we switched off having our appointments at the office and at our house, which is very nice when it comes to building a relationship with your midwife. You can verify that claim with my three-year old daughter who thinks of Allyson as another friend to play with. This relationship that was forged I think not only made things easier on us but it helped my daughter to better understand what was happening and what things were to come in the very near future.  When I look back to the experience we had with our daughter, it went something like this.  Walk into the doctors office and sign in with the lady working the desk with a cold, get called back into the private room and wait 25 minutes to see the doctor/midwife for 10 minutes with the first 5 minutes being them reading the chart to make sure they don't call Mrs. Bryant, Mrs. Jones from the room next door.  With Allyson this was not the case, you can ask all the questions you want and go over all the \"Important Things\" until you are blue in the face and she wont be spending all the time she is with you rambling off random medical terms just to conclude your visit by sending you to the lab to choke down the worst tasting orange soda in the world, (I took a sip so I know). Everything was to the point and concise and within a matter of weeks we had spent more time actually discussing the pregnancy with Allyson then we did the entire time with our daughter, thus leaving us much more prepared for what was to come. \nThe day had come, first and foremost let me add, I should have placed bets at the local casino, I had told my wife that I had this strong intuition that her water was going to break in our bed and Isaiah was coming and she just laughed at me before we went to bed... If only I could have recorded that moment at 3AM when I was nudged and she calmly said, \" Um Raymond, I think my water just broke in our bed.\" Now I in no way want to sound Cauchy but I may have well jumped out of the bed to do a touchdown dance because I was on fire.  We made the call to Allyson and she was at the door in no time ready to go with all the necessary items. This is when I was really able to see the differences between a birth with a midwife and the standard hospital birth that we had experienced with our daughter. As a guy I tend to try and compare scenarios to things that I can fully relate with and being a tattoo artist for many years now, I compare the hospital birth to a tattoo shop, we want you to come in knowing what is going to happen and we may adjust your original plans a little to better fit our needs and then we want to blow that thing out so you are not sitting in our chair for hours on end while we miss opportunities to make more money.  This is a mirror of my opinion of a hospital experience but what we experienced with this home birth could not have been more opposite.", "business_id": "ZFgbfS6MyPyIz2Ek3dyxYg", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-08-05", "type": "review"}
