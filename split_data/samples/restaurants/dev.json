This course is targety and has many split fairways that end in desert. The greens putted really nicely, very fast and smooth. I wasn't super impressed with the starter who questioned me about my HCP like I was being interrogated by the police. I guess he was concerned I wasn't a low enough handicapper to play off the blue or black tees which is silly because the course isn't tough from any tee. He also told us to speed up because we had a hole and a half ahead of us but when  we teed off we never saw a group ahead of us and people weren't waiting behind us so he did the typical ranger power trip and ended up disturbing myself and my group by making us speed up when we didn't need to.\n\nMake extra time to play the putting course out front, 18 holes and very fun.\n\nI payed $30 for a cart, round and all the practice I want, not a bad deal for this time of year I guess if you like a drive out in the middle of no mans land.", "business_id": "is-olmqaSZ0KCoe-_ftW5w", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-05-28", "type": "review"}

I mean, who doesn't love sushi buffets?  For about $20+, you can eat all the sushi, sashimi, and fried seafood your damaged heart can handle.  Sushi Kaya is one of those buffets that'll do it's best to make sure you leave with your money's worth.\n\nLocated in Chinatown, Sushi Kaya is a bit hard to find.  If I remember correctly, it seemed Sushi Kaya and all the buildings around it use the same, if not similar, font.  But once you find it, get ready to eat a plethora of sushi.\n\nWe had a group of about 16 people for a bachelor party.  They seated us in this room that was next to the front entrance.  I think they seated us here because they knew we were trouble, so they would want to shuffle us out of the restaurant ASAP.\n\nThe room was spacious, had comfortable couches, and was set-up with non-working speakers.  Ah yeah, we were giving them hell about the speakers.  They were playing good music in the restaurant, but our room wasn't playing any of the music.  We decided to improvise by putting an iPhone in a cup and see if the sound would amplify and be loud enough for all of us to hear.  Yeah, we're idiots.\n\nAnyways, the menu had a huge selection of different sushi, sashimi, and other delightful items.  All of us ordered 2-3 dishes because we knew it would take a while for them to make and bring in our order.  By the way, you have about 90 minutes to destroy their supply of seafood.  So, you better make every minute count.\n\nI ordered the Spider roll, Eel roll, Caterpillar roll, and then it became fuzzy after that because I think I ordered more beers than food.  Yeah, they brought the liquor faster than the food.  Can't complain!  Oh yeah, they have a Jose roll.  My Mexican friend thought it was only fitting that he ordered it.  He said it was ,\"Muy bien!\"  But yeah, my food was pretty good.  The fish tasted fresh, the rice didn't taste bad, the rolls weren't too saucy, and they gave us decent portions for each roll.\n\nThe staff-- man.  First, if any of the waiters and waitresses are reading this:  WE ARE SO SORRY FOR MAKING YOUR LIFE A LIVING HELL FOR THE 90 MINUTES WE WERE THERE.  Alcohol + 16 guys + No girlfriends/wives to keep us in check = Rebecca Black's Friday.  Wut?  Seriously, thank you staff for being super friendly, cracking jokes with us, and taking the verbal gibberish the drunk bachelor threw at you guys.\n\nSushi Kaya. thank you very much for serving us.  I hope the night you spent with us will forever be branded in your brains.  It was one of many fun times we had in Vegas.  Thanks so much!!!!

So with that in mind, we sometimes need at least a reminder of a few dishes we've been unable to make here. We've visited now 3 times, and each time we had a friendly waiter and they had Abita, and even once, Dixie in a bottle, which sent my husband over the moon (beer, for the uninitiated). Their Bloody Mary's were also pretty good. I have ordered oysters twice, once was great, the other had to be sent back b/c they were underfried. Their french bread, which they get from a local bakery, is spot on. The way it should be. Crunchy and light, not doughy and sweet. If you go, be sure to order a po-boy. It's pretty authentic. However, I would stay away from \"etoufee\" or anything that when not in New Orleans takes a decidedly tourist take on the dish. We took our children for Mardi Gras dinner, and they enjoyed it, even if the waiters had no idea why our children wanted to throw beads at them. \n\nThe atmosphere was comfortable and very New Orleans, and they had coffee with chicory, difficult to find even in the best of circumstances outside the city limits of NOLA. So please, do yourself a favor and get fully caffinated before you leave. Even if it's after dinner. It's no ordinary coffee. You'll be pleased with your pep.

There are places so memorable that they are forever etched in your mind. La Grande Terrasse is one such place. And its so memorable why ?  Because it truly sets the bar for bad service....and the food is not much better. Let me start by saying I love Canada, I practically hum the Canadian National Anthem in my sleep.  When I visit Canada I am always a bit unsure of just where to eat because of the whole language barrier thing and some times I take chances.  They usually work out, but not this one.  The restaurant is in a great location right in Jacques Cartier Square in the heart of Old Montreal.  I went with my wife and a couple friends but unfortunately when we were seated it was also in a location directly in the 90 degree sun. So when the waiter finally graced us with his presence (after ignoring us for about 15 minutes) I quickly ordered an overpriced Bud Light Lime.  After another fifteen minutes of involuntary tanning my beer arrived as well as some water for the rest of the table.  The waiter then left again so we could have some (more) time to read the menu and continue browning. By the time our waiter made it back to the table the other tables around us had all been served meals.  One of the meals had apparently been so good that the guests demanded thier money back and they wanted to immediately see a manager. Good luck with that,  I was still waiting for a sighting of my waiter. While we waited we had plenty of time to watch the sparrows dive in from above and eat the scraps from the patio floor.  Another nice touch was the wasps flying around everyone's head. There is nothing like some biting stinging insects to really add some ambiance to the experience. So after sitting for about 40 minutes we finally got to order some food.  The menu was rather uninspiring but we were all so hungry that at that point we didn't even care. Our friends ordered Poutine with Vegetables, and A Sunshine Salad (somewhat appropriate considering where we were sitting).My wife also ordered Poutine, and I ordered the Steak Steak French Bread Sandwich with a side of Poutine. About another twenty minutes and all the food arrived. My side of Poutine was almost the same size as the entr\u00e9e portions at the rest of the table.  Not only were the portions small but the Poutine was also not that good. The fries were frozen and that always just kind of depresses me.  Mine was also not very hot, and the gravy was forgettable.  The Steak Steak sandwich was mostly vegetables and tasted like roasted red peppers and half cooked onion more then anything else. Perhaps it should have been called a Veggie Veggie sandwich instead. What I did taste of steak tasted somewhat old and frost bitten.  On the bright side, the French bread was actually pretty good.  I didn't dare ask my friend about how her salad was...but it looked like a salad, and was probably more of a meal then the entr\u00e9e portions of Poutine that the others had.  Of course the waiter took his time getting the check to us,  and when he did the bill was not split correctly amongst us. At that point none of us cared so we quickly paid and hit the road, running, as fast as we could never to return.", "business_id": "z6l2Ap_Fyyb8u1dQ3VI9Gw", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-11-23", "type": "review"}

We decided to give Ayala a try, but found a 'we're closed today' sign on their front door once in front of it, so we walked on and found Green Pepper. We arrived between 4:30 and 5, and their kitchen wasn't open yet, but they decided it was close enough, and seated us.\n\nI've seen a lot of 'service' complaints here, but perhaps because there were only six people the entire time were were there, service for us was great. \n\nWe scanned the menu, and ordered drinks. Since they carry only Pepsi products, even iced tea, I opted for a pot of hot green tea and a glass of ice. Perfect.\n\nMy friend ordered the Spicy Pork Do-Shi-Rock, and I ordered the Cold Spicy Noodles. Both of these were in the $14 zone, as opposed to the other much higher zones.  We checked out the appetizers, but decided to skip them when we discovered that the prices for the appetizers were as expensive, sometimes more so, than the entrees.  They looked good, but not for the price of an entree.\n\nThey brought our liquids, which were fine, and then they brought our meals.\n\nThey all came with the variety of Korean side dishes in the bento box, and to be very honest, the food was yummy. My cold noodles did come with a handful of ice cubes in the bowl, which I scooped out so as to not have a melted puddle of weak spice water in the bowl. I wasn't very impressed with the two beef slices in the dish - maybe it was the lighting, but they didn't have a very appealing color. And the flavor was just kind of a dry deli roast beef. But the noodles, the egg, the spice, the ginger, and all of the side dishes were very tasty and filling.  I can't call mine especially 'spicy', but it was good.\n\nMy friend's dish was actually a little TOO spicy for her on this day, but that's a highly unusual occurrence for her (and even more unlikely for me), but she did enjoy the flavors and filled up.\n\nThe waitress was attentive and kind, without attitude, and the assistant manager, a bespectacled and lightly bearded dark haired lad, was dating material...I wanted HIM in a take-out box!\n\nAfter we'd finished out meals, they brought us the persimmon tea 'soup' which was a treat for our tongues, if not a bit astringent after the meal, the check, and lots of smiles.\n\nIf it weren't for the prices, I would become a regular. My tongue LOVES new flavors and different ethnic dishes. I guess, as others have pointed out, it's up to you to decide if you think the prices are worth it.\n\nThe atmosphere was a little odd, but pleasant. A little stark, but I agree with what someone else said about the placement of the tables and plenty of space.  It is really nice to not have the next table in your lap while dining out.\n\nI would very much like to go back and try their Sunday Buffet. $20 for all you can eat of this treat would be soooo worth the price.\n\nLower the prices, keep that cute as hell assistant manager...and the star rating might jump up a notch.", "business_id": "Oq01QS2G1OvCsunccVSgxQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-06-27", "type": "review"}

This is a good place for dinner if you are interested in grabbing a bite after golfing in the area or if youre staying at a hotel nearby, but when they say its in Scottsdale... its in Scottsdale,but not near anything else. lol\n\nWINE. So they do have a great wine list and my favorite thing about ordering wine with dinner... is when the servers know what its best paired with! They do change their wine menu pretty consistently and offer specials on house wines too, so wine is a good choice here. \n\nFOOD. I will admit, the Insalata Caprese appetizer was very good and fresh.... and I dont even like basil. I did feel that 14 dollars was a little steep for such a little serving, but hey. thats fine dining for you isnt it? \nWhatever you do... Try the scallops. The dish was called Spaghetti Alla Roberto. That was by far the best thing I've had here. It comes with shrimp, mushrooms and a wine sauce. The scallops were perfectly tender and just melted in your mouth. I was never the biggest fan of scallops, but I am now. \n\nSERVERS. They did drive me a little nuts after the 9th time coming by asking if i wanted another glass of wine when I had clearly stated that I was going to stick with water for the rest of the dinner. I appreciate the service, but if someone says theyre done. I think you should just trust their judgement and not try to upsell. Also, If i say I dont want dessert, please stop trying to push it! I was stuffed beyond belief, I didnt want anything else, the last thing I need is someone trying to force a menu down my throat and saying things like \"youre gonna regret it\" as he clears our table.

We were seated and received prompt, excellent service.  Our waiter was attentive but not overly so.  It was just the right amount of service, not in our face constantly yet we always had a full glass.  We started with the Naan bread as an appetizer.  This comes with three kinds of spread.  The one was forgettable however the other two, we didn't need the third.  We very much liked the banana chutney, just the right amount of heat.  The hubby does not like hummus but I loved their's.  It was a black olive hummus (and I don't like black olives). Their hummus was perfection!  I chose the Scottish Salmon for my main course.  It comes with what I would describe as a brussell sprout salad.  The brussell sprouts were stemmed and incredibly tasty.  In this salad, so to speak, were chunks of smoked salmon - oh my goodness - I could eat this stuff by the pound.  It was smoked and had just the right amount of saltiness.  I also got a side of mashed potatoes, whipped up to a perfect consistancy (light and creamy and seasoned perfectly).  The hubby enjoyed the honey glazed duck for his main course.

We had to try dessert too, of course.  I got the Tropical Oasis.  it was sweet and tart all at the same time.  It was, most certainly, a tropical oasis in a cup.

It's meh as in nothing to wow me, but not at all a bad-meh as I have gone pretty frequently during half-off hours.  Located right off of Pitt campus, you really can't beat a decent $5 meal.  For half-off on most nights, do expect to wait 15 minutes for a table and 30 minutes for your plate.\n\nThe food is okay.  It's basically average all-American food, although some dishes just aren't well made.  I remember I once ordered a salad dish with guacamole...couldn't finish it because I couldn't ask for water refill fast enough to wash down the over-abundance of flavor...  Then there was a chicken wrap that featured really charred chicken pieces that didn't taste too great and was WAAY too salty.  BUT I know that the potato fries are pretty good and some of their weird pizzas are pretty tasty...  Also, most plates have a good amount of food.  Yay American sizing =)\n\nOverall, I recommend it especially if you're in college.  It has a college atmosphere and helps you stay on a budget.

It's a cool looking truck with some east asian urban graphic design on the sides of it, something you definitely wouldn't miss if you were looking for it on the side of the road. The atmosphere of the places that it goes to is really down to earth. Mostly a bunch of youngsters hanging around showing off their tuned out cars while you grab a bite to eat. Not very many places to sit but when you're coming to eat at a truck I don't think you'd be expecting an abundance of chairs and tables just lined up for your convenience, so it's understandable. The staff is friendly and I think one of the most memorable things while you're just sitting around waiting is that when somebody tips, the person taking the order yells out \"TIP JELLY\" and so does everyone else on the truck and participating customers as well. The wait varies depending upon the time you arrive at the location they're at, but I've been there about 5-6 times and the wait has never taken more than 20 minutes even during their busiest moments.\n\nThe menu is small. 6 Main burgers all unique in their own way, but from what I understand you can customize your burger with extra patties and eggs if you'd like. There's a few other items on the menu but I haven't gotten around to trying them yet so I'll just stick to the burgers.\n\nFor the most part, it is REALLY delicious, especially for it's price. 5 dollars a burger is really decent for what your getting. It's not an overwhelmingly huge burger but remember, quality before quantity. These burgers are just damn good. I ordered the Tamago burger and I don't really remember the other stuff that's on it besides the egg but I do remember how it tastes and boy was it delicious. Their garlic fries are awesome too, especially mixed with the sauce that comes with it.\n\nThis is one of those places you go to when you and your group of friends are hungry and you want something good and quick to grab but you don't want to have to fork out a wad of cash. I have thoroughly enjoyed all of my visits to Fukuburger and I have no doubt that you will too.", "business_id": "I1FRsqEw78xUR2gZBheHOQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-11-06", "type": "review"}

Being so close to the freeway you are likely to pass right by without a second thought.  You can't judge a book by its cover because while the outside says Ugh, the inside of the place is done up very well with thick lacquered wood chairs straight out of a Mexican church.\n\nI was super excited because everyone raved on the salsa, which I have to say was quite a disappointment.  The green was definitely spicy but had absolutely no flavor to it whatsoever, I think I could have accomplished the same thing by mixing cayenne with a corn starch slurry.  The red had a little heat but the overpowering flavor was oregano, not my favorite herb for salsa, where's the cilantro?!?\n\nThe cheese enchilada with rice and beans I ordered is what saved the place.  It was a decent portion of food and tasted great.  A co-worker had the carne asada and I don't think the steak was even marinated and was griddle grilled so it didn't have any char flavor either, it was saved by the guacamole whihc wasn't anything to rave about either.\n\nIf you work downtown and are looking for somewhere new, close, and inexpensive for Mexican food, it's definitely a place to try at least once to gauge against others.", "business_id": "cgNIBHS2mLdbTRiodAT6EQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-08-13", "type": "review"}

I looked at the Yelp reviews and became determined to sample at least one before leaving.  I chose Lemongrass Cafe because it had the highest amount of reviews than any other in town.   Also, found that some reviewers chose to explain that their new Vietnamese restaurant is even better than this place.   I had to try it.    I arrived about 4 pm on Feb 19th.  There was only one other table being served in the whole restaurant - perfect.  I'm not scared.   \n\nThe servers barely speak English - another good sign.   I did not like the size of the menu.  Come on,  make a few incredible dishes and leave the books for the library.   I became overwhelmed with choices.  I had to pull out my Vons $10.00 magnifying glasses to read.  The lighting could improve but I'm not so concerned about interior design.  Although the 1950s malt shop/dinner takes away from the rich Vietnamese scents and cultural paraphernalia.  \n\nI ordered the vegetarian Pho with tofu #59 - Large $8.95   Also dared to ask for \"make your own shrimp and vegetable rice paper wraps\"  off the menu. I figured he understood that it was for me, but since I did not explain, he brough a huge order for way more than one person and hit me with a $19.70 charge.   Ouch !  \n\nMy friend Meese ordered the number 39 Pho Tai / Rare Beef Pho - Large 7.95 and a coke.  \n\nThe off the menu wraps were the best I've ever had.   The noodles were perfectly cooked.  The vegetables, crisp, bright and very fresh.   Plenty of herbs, flowering basil, mint, cilantro, sliced cucumbers, (Boston?) lettuce, and about 20 pieces of perfectly cooked grilled shrimp.   The table had a home made spicy chili - a great compliment for spiciness.   I polished that plate like Homer Simpson eating a box of doughnuts. \n\nThe Pho surprisingly was not as hot as I'm used to having it, however, I had no problem with it.  Normally, Pho upon arrival has to be carefully sipped at the beginning, otherwise you end up with charring of your tongue and mouth.   I was able to dive in free from danger and just inhale it RTC Navy style.  \n\nI should have asked for the cost of any off menu items.  When the server handed the check to me, there was a little bit of hesitation  and a concerned look in his eyes as if that (*&^%$# ) pulls that stuff all the time.    It is still my fault for not asking the price. \n\nWhen I return to Vegas, I will definitely explore all the well rated Vietnamese restaurants.", "business_id": "17FKJgS11HppOf00qXKEqA", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-02-20", "type": "review"}

The rice was mixed with four kinds of japanese mushrooms and beans in a light miso broth, very flavorful, but I thought it was a bit too salty (i do eat less salty than majority of my friends)\n\nDrinks:\n+Tanuki Peach, signature cocktail - Shochu with peach puree, sweet and fruity, a great fresh start of the meal\n+Japanese Pomelo Lemonade - this is NOT your typical lemonade from any other restaurants, they're made from the Japanese pomelo juice (a citrus fruit) with lemons, very citrusy, my friend liked it a lot.

Friends were arriving in Vegas for an event and this was a good first stop.\n\nWalked in the front door and immediately thought it was weird. A few empty tables. Then there was the party room that was being decorated for the New Years festivities. There was no host, no designated server, just people walking around and preparing the place. Decorations for a balloon drop at midnight and the DJ stage. According to one person who worked there, it was sold out.\n\nThe place was empty but I felt like I was intruding. \"Well, you can sit in there but we're getting ready for the party.\" Uh, it's 6:30 already and there wasn't a soul in there. Finally, she agreed to seat us where we wanted, right in the middle of it all. I didn' t want to be in a boring room with no action.\n\nFood was OK, nothing great. I had a Greek salad that was satisfactory. The server ended up being friendly and willing to answer questions about the menu and the plan for the evening. We weren't invited however.\n\nSo, if you're planning and preparing for a party and you don't really want to hassle with any patrons, then lock the door.

Took a look at the menu near the entrance and thought this is probably a very Americanized Chinese restaurant. Half a year later, I was driving around town and noticed a billboard saying they're voted the best Chinese restaurant in Vegas. \n\nSo I gave them a try. The first thing came to my mind - Gold Coast is better than I thought. After minutes of walking through the casino, I finally made it to the restaurant. It's an open space meaning people outside can see inside. The tables are placed in an traditional way and may seem to be too closed to each other if you expect more privacy. \n\nI had no idea they had a long line waiting outside. I was there for at least half an hour. By the time I left there was no line. They did have a waitress come out and ask for party size but I don't think it helped at all.\n\nIt was lunch time, so beside regular menu, they have lots of dim-sum served as well. Actually people go there just for the dim-sum for lunch. I had 9 dishes plus one dessert. (yes I ate it all by myself) Not very good, but not bad either. Also had a mushroom tofu which I couldn't finish there, it was pretty yummy. \n\nI expected the bill to be around 70, but surprisingly it was 47 after tax. Some of the dim-sum I ordered were only 2.88 and some are 3.88, not even close to the price I thought it would be. (Dim-sums are divided into two categories. Every time you get something, they stamp on your paper accordingly) \n\nI laughed when I got the bill.The pronunciation of 8 in Chinese is similar to \"get rich\".

Also, the portion to price ratio is great, and I occasionally am left with great leftovers.

When I'm at dinner, I like to be able to hear the people I'm sitting with.  It's ridiculous, even shouting my mother and I couldn't hear each other.  STK is a place \"to be seen,\" however it wouldn't hurt them to lean more towards restaurant and focus less on trendy.  STK, are you for pregame drinking or are you for fine dining?\n\nLuckily, I suppose, we just stopped in for a snack at the lounge area.  It's situated so you sort of have to be on the couch next to strangers-- but that's okay.  When the cocktail came around, we ordered the hamachi sashimi and beef tartare.  The food took a little while to come out, but it was busy so thats okay too.  \n\nThe music I can live with but the service was really why STK is 2 star to me.  The hamachi was good, nothing to rave about but still good.  Instead of receiving beef tartare we were given beef carpaccio so I let the waitress know, and she rudely said \"Well you said carpaccio not tartare but did you want me to take it back?'  YIKES it's not my fault you can't hear me, the music is really loud!  She took it back and we were promptly delivered tuna tartare.  Closer, but still wrong- we let her know and she kind of just walked away.  When she came back (we hadn't touched it) she asked us if we wanted to keep it... confused if she meant keep that instead or keep that also, we just said no just the beef tartare please.  Finally the beef tartare came out from an apologetic busser and it was like the hamachi, good but not the best.  Everyone in the lounge seats next to us had that supposedly amazing bread that everyone keeps yelping about.  Is it complementary?  We never received any... was it because she found us to be difficult?  I also ordered a beet salad to go.  When it says that it comes with arugula, it means a few sprigs.  I would call it more of a side order roasted beets.\n\nI would try STK again because I feel like I need to try some steak and that amazing \"complementary\" bread, but are they open for lunch?

The original offer for a table (after waiting for an hour already) was to split our party into the two separate rooms of the restaurant at twe very distant tables. The server that offered this was not only curt, but her words were \"it makes it really hard on us\" to seat our party. Personally, having worked in the industry for ten years, i would NEVER say something to this affect to a paying customer!  When we were finally seated, there were only a chips and salsa appetizer for almost fifteen minutes before our order was ever taken. When our food was finally delivered, two of the persons in the group were not served. Their food was not delivered to the table until everyone else was finished with our over cooked and very dry tacos. This was something that was never acknowledged as a short coming on the restaurants behalf. At the risk of sounding cheap, there was never an offer to comp their plates, or compensate in any matter.  When it came time to deliver the bill, the server had no idea who had what. The bills were jumbled, and as a matter of fact some of them were even PAID TWICE (considering one of our party felt sympathetic to the futile efforts of the staff and stayed behind as the rest of the party left and later found out the tab had actually been paid) !!! Fortunately for the server, he was paid AND TIPED double for at least one of the tabs for his less than mediocre efforts. I will NEVER return to this restaurant, and recommend anyone with more than three, or four people in their party not confuse and overwhelm the staff by their presence. \n\nHorrible service, food and poor attitudes!", "business_id": "n5eQnMnVVt3FfrFENYoU0g", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-11-03", "type": "review"}

I bought the Yelp Deal: $20 for $10.  I've decided that Groupon mostly sends you to places that are having troubles for a reason.  That is, I'm usually disappointed with the Groupon experiences.  Yelp Deals, on the other hand, have turned out pretty good so far.  This place is a little far from home.  Usually, if I drive this far then I just go on down to Chinatown.  Parking was ok.  Upon entering I turned to my girlfriend and commented about how this was probably going to be a bad experience because the place was totally empty.  It was around 6:45 pm on Tuesday.  But, we settled in determined to give it a fair try.  I began noticing all of the nice things about the place.  It was nicely decorated.  I assume the owner did the decorating.  I describe it as contemporary Asian.  It was not high end Vegas strip decorating style, but more like well put together do it yourself style.  The kitchen was in full view of the dining area.  I always like that.  I cringe to think what goes on out of sight.  So many restaurant shows today let us normal people peek behind the curtain and witness the often disgusting truth.  Also, I was delighted to see Asian people making Asian food.  At least makes me believe I'm in for authentic flavors.  Modern music played lightly over the audio system.  It was pleasant.  I assume the man waiting on us was the owner, David Wong.  He was very friendly and attentive.  He did a really good job.  He tried very hard to give us a great experience.  Every item on the menu was under $11.  That's pretty good.  I like good food, but I enjoy it even better when I feel like I'm getting a good deal.  The menu had a variety of Asian dishes, as the name implies: Thai, Malaysian, Vietnamese, etc.  We ordered two dishes.  The first was Filet Mignon Pho.  It was a Thai version of Vietnamese Pho.  My Thai girlfriend explained that the abundance of roasted garlic was a signature difference.  The sauces were all added before serving.  The veggies were slightly different (can't explain) and the meat was filet mignon (Wow! Step It Up!).  The noodles were cooked just right.  I enjoyed the Pho, but there are way better places to get Pho in this town.  The second dish was Basil Sauace Stir Fry.  It had chicken, sweet basil, garlic, chili tomatoes, and long beans served with rice.  Spiciness was 8 out of 10.  It was really tasty.  I specifically enjoyed the fresh veggies.  My only complaint was that the dish had too much oil.  I realized just how much after we finished the dish and were left staring at the puddle before us.  It made me feel a little bad about something I had just enjoyed.  We were pretty much full, but wanted to spend at least $20 for the Yelp deal so we ordered another entree.  We had asked the server earlier what their signature dish was.  He recommended the Pad-See-Yaw.  So, that's what we ordered.  It was pan-fried flat noodles with pork, broccoli, black soy beans, and egg.  My girlfriend explained that this dish is commonly ordered by Caucasians at Thai restaurants.  She was surprised that I had never heard of it (we usually eat Thai food at her house, not restaurants).  It was very sweet.  My girlfriend and the server had a quick conversation in Thai.  He asked if we wanted a dessert.  We said no, but I thought the sweet Pad-See-Yaw was dessert.  After he left, my girlfriend explained that she told him it was too sweet and he replied that its how Americans like it.  I thought that was funny.  We were already full when the third dish came out so we tasted it and put it in a to go box.  The server came by and chatted with us for a while.  He explained that he had been open for about nine months.  Before that he had a successful high end Asian restaurant in Florida.  Articles hung on the wall behind us explaining it.  By the time we left it had become pretty busy.  The place had four or five more couples and a few take out customers came through.  Overall, it was a good experience.  The server was attentive and the food came out fast.  The menu was very affordable.  The decorations were interesting and inviting.  I really wanted to give it five starts, but  the food was good, not great.  Its worth a try.", "business_id": "8HCC8NuJmdHnEg2XC00NPg", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-02-01", "type": "review"}

I had planned on going to Charlie's for MNF's kickoff double header as I was told it was a great MNF location.  I debated going since the 1st game was already underway and I was sure the place would be packed due to the game and the storm.  WRONG!\n\n 1st of all the place is bigger than it appears, but was primarily empty.  The staff almost outnumbered the customers and the service was still just ok. I did like their happy hour and game specials, but still surprised how dead it was.  All of the TVs were tuned to the game, though most people there were oblivious to it.  The vast majority was on their cell texting or playing video poker and smoking like a chimney.\n\nThe food was very good and reasonable.  I went with the Stromboli which was excellent and more than big enough for left overs.  It was very fresh, hot and stuffed to the max making it delicious.  Washed down with a nice cold beer and even the less than perfect weather and crappy game it was a good night.\n\nI was surprised how smoking the place was although it was primarily empty.  Guessing on the response of staff when the micro system went down twice in 2 hours, I would think it went down pretty often.  They were happy I could pay with cash as their credit card system was also down.

They specialize in authentic style pizzas with an innovative flare, to elevate pizza up a step from your average pizza joint. And they served it elevated too, on a little metal stand so that we could double-tier our pizzas all over the table. My dinner companions were visible above the landscape of lifted pizzas that overtook our table, and we tucked in with vigor.\n\n Their space is a cozy little spot in a re-purposed gun shop. They've kept the gun motif in their decorations as a nod to the previous establishment, in a very tasteful way. (Gun rack wine racks, for example.)\n\nWe had a group of 7, and had 6 different pizzas. 5 of them were unmodified specialty pizzas directly off the menu, and 1 modified build-a-pizza of sorts. All were delicious, hot, crispy and well thought out.  My favorite was the 'Goomba,' a mushroom and garlic based mix. But I thoroughly enjoyed the pork confit \"Puerco\" pizza, and the watercress and honey-touched 'Barberini' was a big hit as well.  \n\nWe also enjoyed an appetizer of the pork confit, which was offered to us as a gift of the house while we waited for our pizzas, since it would take a while to have all 7 pizzas ready. An unexpected and unnecessary windfall, we gobbled it all up gratefully. and ungracefully. \n\nAt the end we also ordered a couple of their sticky ginger cakes, which I believe must have had a lemon cream topping, and these were also destroyed in short order. Warm, sticky, moist and creamy, they had a slight crisp to the edges in the very best sort of way. (We ordered these partly because of their open-view kitchen window, which can be viewed from the entryway and from a few of their tables. As we were all restaurant industry people, we were watching the kitchen with undisguised interest. We saw the chef plating the ginger cake, piling the whipped cream on the top artfully, after which he stuck the spoon into his mouth, cleaned it with obvious relish, and threw the spoon into the dish pit. You know when you see that, that the cream must be delicious if it's worth licking off the spoon every time.\n\nFor some reason it was difficult for the waitress to do 4 separate checks, but we did our own math with a pen she provided, and lucky for her we were able to figure it out without stiffing her. A less mathematically inclined group might have accidentally stiffed her.\n\nThey also offered us some mini orange macaroons at the end, which were the strangest, gooiest little macaroons I have ever had. That's not really a complaint, just an observation that they were unexpected in terms of the texture inside. Besides, who cares! Free candy!\n\nWe will be back, Grandpa.", "business_id": "SMMG0t2uJCK2LVdMiXv68w", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-01-29", "type": "review"}

The meal begins with a lovely vegetable crudite on ice and their famous butter garlic leek bread, served by professionals who are friendly and on top of their game, and a support staff that ensures you never see the bottom of your glass. \n\nNot content to simply deliver a solitary piece of meat on the plate like some ultra-high-end chop houses, their steaks include a salad and choice of potato, which is greatly appreciated.\n\nWe always upgrade to their Caesar salad, which borders on perfection: the dressing coats everything lightly, the plate is freezing cold as damn well it should be, and the lettuce is extremely fresh and crisp.\n\nIf you want to splurge, their shrimp cocktail, while a bit pricey, features four enormous, two-bite-each jumbo shrimp, with a stir-it-yourself-thank-god cocktail sauce with some of the hottest horseradish known to man. The details matter: the lemon they provide has a sheath to ensure that the juice goes on your shrimp and not your date.\n\nThe main event is fantastic, though I must admit I've simply never ordered anything other than the prime rib, rare, with a baked potato. It's seasoned beautifully, extremely flavorful, and always served to perfection. The baked potato is good, though I prefer when they're coated in just a bit more salt on the outside. My wife tried their garlic mashed our last time, though, and I think I may have to switch from here on out--they were that good.\n\nDessert, if your heart allows for it, is also typically great. The strawberry shortcake for two is actually for four, and, pro tip, you can order a half portion and still have enough for three people easily. Our last visit was for my birthday and they brought out their brownie sandwich, which was extremely tasty and appreciated.\n\nWe've always had great service, the decor is true to its roots, and if you haven't been during the holidays, Durant's does it UP at Christmas.

We're not ones for the club scene, so we got there much earlier in the evening (around 6:30 pm on Friday) to experience Hyde in its daily, early evening, cocktail lounge mode featuring a surprising array of craft cocktails.  Located just off of the casino floor, Hyde has a sexy, cool, chic ambiance, but its best feature is its spectacular front row view of the Bellagio's signature fountains.  As such, you're treated to a great view of the fountain show, which provides a beautiful backdrop for the entire space.\n\nAlthough the lounge was pretty much empty but for a handful of other guests and we could've sat pretty much anywhere, we elected to sit at the bar.  At the risk of getting smacked on the head by the gf for noticing, Hyde's bartenders and cocktail waitresses were extremely attractive.  Haley, our bartender, was no exception, but more importantly she was exceedingly personable, professional, and passionate about her cocktail making.  I started off with the Ruby-Rye Cooler ($18) made with Bulleit Rye, Founders Ruby Port, and pineapple and lemon juices.  It was a bit on the sweet side from the port and pineapple juice for my personal taste, but not cloyingly sweet.  It was still an enjoyable, refreshing drink.  More enjoyable (and much more fun) was my gf's choice, the Jose Andres inspired liquid nitrogen cocktail ($20), made tableside by one of the lovely cocktail waitresses, using a bunch of unidentified ingredients and liquid nitrogen. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hyde-bellagio-las-vegas?select=7__FShVFi-Hys58WR6gFWw#7__FShVFi-Hys58WR6gFWw Less a true cocktail and more a whimsical, boozy, Egg Nog ice cream, it was fun to watch being made and more fun spooning into my mouth.  Pricey, sure, but it was good tasting entertainment!  Closing out our visit, the gf and I split Hyde's signature cocktail, the Love Unit ($18) expertly made by Haley with Stoly Elit, Stoly Vanilla, muddled Thai basil, fresh lime and grapefruit juices, and \"hand extracted\" (a fancy way to say \"muddled\"?) bell pepper juice. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hyde-bellagio-las-vegas#tD8KZt-W5LAktIVrKLqOaQ  I'm not really big on vodka based cocktails, but the Love Unit really struck gold as the Stoly allowed the bell pepper and Thai basil to shine.\n\nI don't know what Hyde Bellagio is like after 10 pm, but I certainly liked my early evening cocktail lounge experience.  It's not an inexpensive stop for drinks, but it's in line with prices on the Strip and it's still cheaper than the exorbitant prices being charged for inferior drinks at Lily http://www.yelp.com/biz/lily-bar-and-lounge-las-vegas#hrid:WxrU1pRUwFnkNSHEqVgX6g/src:self .

My friend and I went there the Saturday after Christmas for brunch/lunch.  We were initially impressed with the decor inside and our server was very nice.  We both were in the mood for more of a lunch than brunch.  At this time on Saturday's, they only offer a very limited amount of choices that are not on the brunch menu.

My salad was sub par at best.  The only thing that I liked were the french fries and honestly how hard is it to screw that up?  My salad was drenched in this kind of gross ranch and had peppers all throughout it that were tasteless.  My steak was cooked right, but the quality of the meat was not good...very chewy.  The coffee was good but we did have to ask our server a few times to refill our drinks (they had been empty for awhile and the place was dead...we were one of only three tables).  The bathrooms were out of soap and toilet paper.  When we told the staff they didn't seem to care.  I have had better, fresher salads at GetGo.  I won't be back...ever.

One word: amazing.  I had the Japanese Wagyu Ribeye, and it literally melted in my mouth.  The meat was so tender and so fatty - it was unbelievably delicious.  At first, I could not imagine what type of meat would cost $160 for 6oz, but one bite of this completely blew me away.  A few more bites of this filled me up, as the meat was so rich.  Luckily, my boyfriend had the traditional USDA Prime Ribeye 16oz so we shared our meats.  For those who has no one to share with, I would recommend the tasting menu (Japanese Wagyu From Kagoshima Prefecture 2 Oz, American \"Kobe Style\" From Snake River Farms 4 Oz, U.S.D.A. PRIME Dry Age From Nebraska 4 Oz) so you have a sampling of all 3 levels of meats and you will not be overwhelmed by the Wagyu.  \n\nThe quality of the meats was great, and obviously this was a very expensive meal.  Without any appetizers, wine, sides, or dessert, our bill came out to be almost $300.  Oh, they also bring around a bread basket in the beginning, and you have the option of many many different types of breads.  They were all delicious!

The interior decor is flawlessly hip-retro, and the table service is more than adequate.\n\nSince time immemorial, breakfast restaurants counted on making money on volume and turnover rather than margin. But now at the upper end of the breakfast market, it seems they are pushing more to increase margins, as in $9 for 3-ingredient omelette with a side of hashbrowns. The meats on the side (including very good sausage) are an extra $2.50-$3.50. So count on, like, $15 for an omelette, a side of bacon, and a cup of coffee.

Some people are weird about buying pizza and sides that they have to bake at home, but that's just some people being weird. There is usually some type of deal going on and they send coupons in the mail, so with any type of deal it is really worth it considering what a frozen pizza costs and tastes like. You can call your order ahead or stop in and watch them make it fresh. You can choose lighter or extra sauce, cheese and toppings to customize the pizza to your liking. The employees inside this Papa Murphy's are friendly and helpful with going over specials, but when I went on grand opening day, the people there from Sunny 106.5 were very rude and didn't help represent Papa Murphy's well. I was actually relieved to find out it was the radio station being so rude and not the actual Papa Murphy's employees because it would have detoured me from going back. I did score a free pizza (the very last one, nice!) because they were giving out 100 free pizzas to customers that day. \n\nThey have pizzas of all shapes and sizes. They have the mini-murph pizza kit to take home so your kids can put together a pizza for themselves and then see their creation after it bakes. The pizzas also come in signature, pan, delite and stuffed crusts. Most of the pizzas bake at 425 and only take around 10 minutes aside from the stuffed pizza which takes around 25 minutes. The pan pizza is definitely good, but beware when cooking the pan pizza and keep your eye on it because there is butter or something at the bottom of that one and it can burn easy if you let it go too long and when you take the pan pizza out of the oven it's really hot, so let it stand for 5 minutes before slicing. The cheesy bread comes in regular and thicker sizes, both being equally delicious. With a coupon I usually pay about $6 or $7 for a pizza and adding 2 sides it's $6, not including the thicker cheesy bread. One thing I tried on my last visit that I hadn't before is the s'mores dessert pizza. Wow that thing was good! I preferred the s'mores pizza much more than the chocolate chip cookie dough they offer and it is a great price as one of the 2 sides you can pick. My hubby likes the cookie dough here, but I personally do not. If you are signed up for the e-club they usually send you a coupon for free cookie dough on your birthday. They also have pumpkin shaped pizzas at Halloween time and heart shaped pizzas for Valentine's Day, usually at a special price that I like to pick up. All in all this is a decent take-n-bake pizza spot.", "business_id": "y8cp1qzfJ0h0VfWOxn8Vjw", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-10-18", "type": "review"}

By then we had ample time to look over the menus given us on arrival and were seated at a decent sized table. The crepes were exceptional and they didn't take that long to arrive.

I've gotta say this is a hard place to bring little kids.  It's crowded, some of the seats are high and it's just too loud to be a family type dining experience.

It was on the fly, had a group of teen girls that needed fed.  I ordered the 20 pc meal, 2 mash, 2 slaw, and 1 mac.  The sides were fine, yet hard to screw up pre-made side items.  The biscuits were hot, yet oddly enough....Half of them were only the top half.  The chicken, the meat of the meal and matter, was 11 thighs, 2 breasts, 3 legs, and 1 wing.....An odd bird, considering it should have been a straight 5 pieces each.  My family doesn't really care for the thighs, daughter likes legs and wings, wife and I are breast people (yes, I know how that sounds).  We figured the dogs would like the thighs, so you can imagine our thought when the one piece we were tolerating dominated the bunch.\n\nI walked back in the store, and everyone that has ever worked behind a restaurant counter KNOWS, that when a strange person walks into the store with restaurant bags....It isn't a good sign.  So when she asked what I wanted, I politely asked for the MOD.  She didn't understand, I asked again but for the Manager on Duty.  She still did not or choose not to understand me.  I then asked 6 more times, it was a really bad game of whose on first.  To the point that the other customers were laughing.  The General manager came out, and I explained the situation.  He politely said he would fix the situation.  Packed up 5 breasts and sent me on my way.  I wasn't thrilled, but didn't want to waste my day on this.\n\nUpon arriving home, finally getting the chance to eat myself, I put one on the plate with some mashed.  The exterior of the chicken looked fine, but the minute I took a bit and started to chew, the rancid flavor and odor hit me.  After excusing myself for thirty minutes to the bathroom, I returned to examine the chicken.  The exterior and 1/2 inch into the chicken looked normal.  The remaining interior of the chicken was a complete mushy mess....That chicken was so far from it's sell by date that I can't believe I didn't catch it on first examination.  I will say though, it has been hours, and I still have not been able to get that taste out of my mouth or get my stomach settled.....And I was in the Army, and have a pretty tough stomach, but rotten chicken....\n\nNow to add insult to injury, I was exceedingly polite to both the drive thru teller for the extreme wait, and the store manager because I explained to them that I once was a KFC GM and DM.  So I knew what it was like to be in their shoes.  So if anything I hope this review has a bit more weight, I know what the standards are at KFC and know that this location falls far short of them, to the point of it being a safety issue.\n\nWhat is sad, this cost forty bucks, 2 hours of my time and who knows how long to recover.  It was a far cry from Hot, Fresh, and Fast.  Just glad I got to the rancid chicken before my family did.", "business_id": "lgMFDLFxGDon26AMizZSlQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-01-08", "type": "review"}

As a non American I was excited by this prospect, but a little let down by the fact that things like \"Kikkoman soy sauce\" make it onto the \"International Aisle\" and that 80% of the \"international section\" seems to be hispanic food, with most of the rest being Kosher.\n\nWhere Glaziers really gets a chance to shine is their \"food court\" style area and in their fresh foods departments. The meats are of decent quality and the fruit and vegetables are very well priced.\n\nUnfortunately the pre-made foods are giving Whole Foods nothing to worry about. The variety is extremely small and unremarkable and unless you want five different types of potato salad you won't be coming back for too much of it.   There is a HUGE opportunity for Glaziers here and I would really love to see them expand on this section and add a little variety and imagination.\n\nThe food court is of average quality - the Pizzas look fantastic and are good, if a little soggy (although I think that's generally how NY style pizza is - In my opinion the tip of a slice of pizza should not sag to point straight at the ground when you pick it up). Again, some variety here would really add to things.\n\nGlaziers - you have my attention. You are an excellent step away from the depressingly generic supermarkets that plague The United States. I always enter your store with high hopes and walk out with a trolley load of groceries but feeling vaguely disappointed. A little more imagination and you could be great.

Memorable in its decor but nothing more. It looks really nice inside - like a place that's been around a while but it's pretty new! It's a sort of Hollywood interior that makes you think important people must dine there.\n\nFirst of all, service almost forgot about us. Like.. they didn't know we were there. Later, bread was served.\n\nWe had been eyeing the lobster mac and cheese since we heard about it. It looks fantastic. That was our starter. You know what? You can't call something lobster mac and cheese if you treat the lobster like a topping of grated parmesan. The whole dish was salty as well. This is fine for a couple bites but becomes overwhelming shortly after. The cheesy sauce itself was delicious. How could it not be?\n\nThe black bass. Two small pieces of bass placed atop cauliflower, all bathing in a salty, sharp grenobloise sauce (basically butter and capers). The bass was cooked well and I imagine delicious. Unfortunately, it was utterly overpowered by the sauce it was swimming in. This is fine for a fish, but not for a human enjoying his dinner. I think it would have been better with the sauce on the plate instead of poured over the food. This also caused the croutons to get soggy. I mean... why?\n\nThe duck. As many have said - probably the better choice of the two. Pan roasted and tender. If you're a duck lover, I think this is going to be a gem. It's served over heirloom carrots and a very light sauce. Roasted shallots are also accompanying this piece. The carrots were a bit overcooked but otherwise the dish was great.\n\nI'm not sure we would be back, but we generally had a good time. It's a classy looking place with a good vibe going on inside. Cozy with good wines. Though, we probably wont be back - it's not to say it isn't worth your visit.

Pizzeria Bianco was mentioned quite often.  Some said it was the best pizza in Phoenix, while others said they were known nationally for their pizza.  Since we were only a few blocks away, we headed over on a Saturday night to check it out. \n\nThe first thing you notice when you get there is how small the location is.  It's an old house that's been converted into a restaurant.  There are approximately 12 tables, along with bar seating for an additional 10 people or so.  Since it was a Saturday night, the wait time was 30-45 minutes.  \n\nYou have the option of waiting outside at the picnic tables next to the restaurant, but seeing how Phoenix is in the middle of a desert that's not a great option during the summer.  What is a great option is walking next-door to Bar Bianco.  It's also an old house that's been converted, but this time into a bar and lounge area.  It makes for the perfect spot to have an adult beverage and relax while you wait for your table.  And the system they have in place is stress-free.  When your table is ready, the hostess calls over to the bartender to let them know.  Easy as can be.\n\nWe ended up sitting at the bar, which worked out great because the bartender shared lots of information about the restaurant with us.  Bianco is known for their artisanal pizza, in the certified Neapolitan style.  We ordered three pizzas as well as an appetizer, so we could try a little bit of everything.\n\nFirst up was the appetizer of Spiedini, which consisted of Fontina cheese wrapped in prosciutto, served warm over a bed of greens (spinach, I believe).  Warmed Italian meat and cheese? Yes, please!  Next up were the pizzas; Margherita, Sonny Boy, and Wiseguy.  All of the pizzas are cooked in the wood-fired oven, giving the thin crust a delicious crispness.  The Margherita was delicious in its simplicity of tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, and basil.  The Wiseguy had sausage and the most amazing caramelized onions I've ever tasted, thick sliced and full of seasoning.  These are the kind of onions you would expect to be served as a side dish at a high-end steakhouse.  But my favorite pizza of the night was the Sonny Boy.  I loved the sodium-laden combination of salami and kalamata olives.  It may be too salty for some, but I thought it was perfect.\n\nAlthough the Sonny Boy was my favorite, the other two weren't far behind.  It's a very simplistic menu, with only a few preset options of pizza.  But everything we tried was awesome, and the reputation for being the best pizza in Phoenix appears to be well earned.", "business_id": "VVeogjZya58oiTxK7qUjAQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-11-07", "type": "review"}

Me and my party of three came here and were welcomed by the managers promptly and told for us to enjoy our meal. We had our drink orders in and we had ordered the santa fe queso and onion rings for starters. The onion rings were rather good, but the queso was just a mess. It really tasted like the queso that I purchase from the store for my sporting events in my house. Everyone in my party ordered a variety of burgers(we're not very original). I chose the mac and cheese as a side, which I thought was also just okay. They were a bit cold, and to spend 2.49$ on a side I expected at least more than ~4 bites of mac and cheese.

Next time I'm in Scottsdale I'm going here. Oh and the staff is great and so is the atmosphere", "business_id": "v7OwbHgNgy_VQ9eP5FjvUA", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-06-27", "type": "review"}

Our school's PTSA set up a fundraiser \"Spirit Day\" two months ago with the owner, Nick.  Today, I took my boys and their friend for lunch right after getting out of their last day of school at 12:20pm.  The boys each ordered two slices of pizza and a drink.  I let the cashier know that we were from West Wing and he looked at me very puzzled.  I told him we were from West Wing School, you know the fundraiser?  He asked if I had a flyer and I said know, but we were told it was okay to just say we were from West Wing.  So, I contacted our Spirit Dinner Nights Chair person and she spoke with him.  When he got off the phone with her, he said \"Everything is all good, I've had four fundraisers this week.\"  No apologies, but I was happy that he said everything was good.  I talked to the Chair person and she said he would accept people saying they were from West Wing and if they had a flyer.\nSix slices of pizza took 40 minutes and they were soggy, dripping grease. :(  But, we still were having a good time and the pizza crust was good.\nWe left Brothers Pizza and not even 15 minutes later I get a call from the Spirit Dinner Nights Chair and she tells me a family from West Wing just went into Brother's Pizza and told them they were from West Wing, the cashier asked if they had a flyer and they said the did not have one.  The cashier said then no money will go to West Wing from your order.  So that family walked out!\nWow, I cannot believe a business would let people just walk out.  I cannot believe the owner, Nick, lied to my face and lied to my Chair person over the phone!\nI can promise you this, I will not go back to Brother's Pizza, nor recommend it.

I can think of several places with better fish tacos so I do not understand what the fuss is all about.  If you like a better fish taco at a good price in this area, go to Habeneros.  It is a shame Rumbies is now out of business, it was a far superior meal at a better price.  If you think paying $11 for a 2 mediocre fish tacos is acceptable, then go ahead and try it.

You're still ON the strip, as opposed to places like Rio and Palms or any other hotel off the strip.\n\n3. You get a bit of the old Vegas feel. \n\n4.

That's why hotels can comp your room and still take you for a ride. Why not save on your lodging costs and put that towards better restaurants, shopping and booze! \n\nIf you're planning a romantic get-away with a gold digger you're trying to impress, don't stay here.

Parking was pretty easy; I found a number of free street side spots along Euclid Ave, north of Bryant St.  \n\nThe very first thing I noticed before I visited the restaurant was their marked difference in price.  For the same dishes, Smiling Banana Leaf had at least a 2-3 dollar price advantage on almost all the main dishes compared to those at Bangkok Balcony.  The only two things that were to be determined at dinnertime were quality and quantity.\n\nWe ordered and split a Som Tum (papaya salad) spiciness level 5, Red Curry with chicken spiciness level 5, and basil pork spiciness level 5.  The red curry was delicious: not too rich like some places make them (with regular coconut milk instead of low fat coconut milk), and just the right quantity. the papaya salad was actually perched upon a bed of greens, a change from the usual way I have it (without the bed of greens, obviously).  there was a tad bit too much dressing, which I will take a note of next time i order the dish, which was otherwise tasty.  lastly, the pork of the basil pork was slightly tough. the pork didn't seem very fresh or something, perhaps due to the fact that most people order chicken.  not sure though: i wouldn't deter anyone from trying it!\n\nCutting this review short, someone in my vicinity is complaining that i'm writing a novel. so...good thai iced tea! potent tea flavor without too much of that condensed milk mixed in (usually the point of failure in man other establishments).  In summary, I'll be coming here from now on.  Cheers for great Thai food in Pittsburgh!", "business_id": "vcZWlI0eHiGwlUfP-5Ov8Q", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-03-10", "type": "review"}

There was a 20 minute wait so we went to the bar to wait and have a drink and an appetizer, our table came up around 15 minutes later and we asked the batender to transfer our bill ( I left him a tip on the bar) he said he couldnt transfer alcohol. What? Ive worked and still work in the industry for 20 years and have never heard of such a rule. He was probably afraid that he wouldnt get tipped.  We were hoping to be out in time for fireworks so right when we sat down my friend tells Heather, our server, that he'll have the lasagne due to the fact that he knows it takes 45 minutes. She put in the order and when she came back, we were all ready to order. 2 people ordered a salad , 1 guy got a pasta dish and the other 2 of us decided on pizza. We were told the stuffed takes an hour so we opted for the thin crust. She says \"do you guys want things as they come up\"? We said \"No, we want to have dinner together\" (Thats why we all went there TOGETHER, duh). She says she'll \"time it out best she can\". So, after 45 minutes pass, he gets his lasagne and nobody elses food comes up. So, we wait and wait. 20 minutes more pass and we havent seen our server, a manager, or our food. (Lasagne got cold, by the way). He gets up and goes to ask the manager where our food and/or server are and hes told \" you got your food and you guys have drinks, so your good, right?\" An hour and 40 minutes after we sat down, we all had food ready and asked to have it boxed so we could try to catch fireworks. (Which we missed because Heather isnt very good at \"timing it out\". She also obviously lacks communication because if she wouldve just came to our table and told us what happened which is obvious, she tried to time it right for us but forgot to put in the rest of the order and didnt realize it til the lasagne came up, we wouldve been fine. She avoided our table instead and the jackass of a manager didnt even try  to help the situation. He was completely unprofessional and said something to her in front of us. What a jerk! 4 out of the 6 people at that table are industry people and have been there and made the same mistake. We totally wouldve understood but the way this was handled was horrible. To boot, as we left, they said in unison..very snidely I might add... \"Enjoy the rest of your 4th\"....just awful business altogether!", "business_id": "kFVapB4z_5VoOnYazF_ERA", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-07-08", "type": "review"}

This place went above and beyond to accommodate us, I went from beyond grumpy to relaxed and pleased when we left. My wife and I split the the Pasta Trio and a Romaine Wedge salad, everything came on two separate plates and and I am sure they bumped up the portions sizes to accommodate us splitting the plates.

It is beautiful, it is stunning, it is classy and it makes me wish I went with a significant other and canoodled in the booth in the back\n\n3) The creamed corn is out of this world, I will salivate about it at random times throughout the day when I have a flashback about its awesomeness...and I usually hate creamed corn\n\n4) The scallops are amazing.  Nothing more needs to be said\n\n5) The hostess/host pulls the table out from the booth if you are seated at one.  Now that, my friends, makes me feel like less of an awkward fool trying to shuffle in and more like an elegant lady sitting down to a fine meal!\n\n6) The filet mignon is the most succulent, juicy, flavorful piece of meat that I have had in a long, long time\n\n7) The atmosphere is inviting.  So many times you go to a restaurant and you feel as if you are just another person waiting to eat before they shove you out the door.  Not at Hanks.  At Hanks they invite you to cozy on up to the fire (that has a fish tank in it) and stay awhile, maybe even put your feet up\n\n8) The steamed Alaskan king crab legs are the biggest things I have ever seen.  They literally hang off the plate.  They are served ready to eat and the butter is heated in your very own flame heated mini bowl so you don't have to share...mmmmmmm\n\n9) The service was impeccable.

Come here to unwind with a drink at the bar while taking in the ambiance (can get very loud) or come here for date night and sit in the back where it's darker and possibly romantic to some? Ha!\n\nThey tend to have a daily menu, which can be quite extensive and you stop paying attention after 10 seconds of a 5-min rambling of today's special. At one point, I did have to ask our waitress to kindly repeat the dessert menu since I had forgotten what she had said 2 Min's earlier. She didn't mind repeating it after she gave me a hard time but eh it's all fair.\n\nFood is actually enjoyable and generous portions for the higher prices. It's interesting to see the fusion between Caribbean and New Mexican food. Being from New Mexico, I grew up on the infamous green & red chile (chili) so it's always a pleasure to see places use it to it's full potential. I must admit that the Jamaican Green Chile Chicken Curry soup was quite enjoyable but I wish it had a stronger curry flavor as the curry taste seemed to disappear within seconds. \n\nThe NM slow-cooked pork bowl was huge and quite spicy just like I remember NM red chile being. Due to the meat/rice ratio, you would need to add another egg to calm the burning sensation you might experience while eating it as one of my friend's stated. When I asked to have my leftovers to be boxed, I was a little sad to find out the waiter-in-training had thrown my leftovers away :( BOOOOO!\n\nMy guest had the braised short ribs and those too were quite delectable. The meat was so tender that it just fell apart. She wasn't a fan of the house rice that it came with so the waitress accommodated her by bringing a bowl of white rice. That seemed to make my guest happy.\n\nThe wait staff was um, interesting to say the least. Though very friendly servers, it's not the typical service you would get from other higher end places. They joke around with you, let you whack them with wet towels (waiter who threw away my leftovers) and can be quite sarcastic. If you're offended by sarcasm, perhaps this isn't the place for you.

They weren't really all that crispy, but the coating was seasoned right and they had some homemade ranch on the side for dipping. The sweet potato fries were also really good, sliced really thin and served with a yogurt dipping sauce that gave them a Middle Eastern feel. The regular fries were also really tasty, sprinkled with herbs and Parmesan cheese and served with a truffle aioli! \n\nI ordered the Turkey burger with pepper jack cheese, avocado, lettuce and mayo. I had been wanting a turkey burger since last week, so I had high hopes for this, and well, my expectations were not only met but exceeded! The turkey was juicy, seasoned well and the combination of the cheese and the generous amount of avocado made it just perfect! They make the buns fresh with a combination of white and wheat flour, and wow, they are so fresh and delicious! \n\nThe others in my group had the Zinburger and the Plain and Simple burger, both of them really liked them, saying the meat had good flavor and was cooked well.

I can't stop thinking & raving about it. \n\nFirst, made reservations in May, knowing I was coming in July, and thank God i'm a planner because I hear they're booked til July although their bar and lounge area is first come, first serve.\n\nReservations at 7, arrived 10-15 minutes early and the kind hostess said we could take a pic in the photobooth (free!) cool! She then said our table was ready, gave us a tour (cool, being a cook myself), friendly staff working hard but still stopped to smile and say hello, welcome! We went to our table and it wasnt ready but she assured us our new table would have an even better view (awesome! 5 minutes later it was a better view and worth the extra 5 mintues).\n\nOur waiter Gregory. What an asset to the Giada team. Knowledgable, friendly, and made the best recommendations. Thank you!\n\nDrinks: complimentary tasty little drink from Giada, I wish I werent TOO excited to take in everything then I wouldve remembered what he said it was. Delicious! Thank you Giada.\n\nGregory recommended a cocktail that was seriously the most light, refreshing, perfect cocktail. It was pink & pretty! (Horrible with remembering the name)\n\nApps: stuffed dates for my meat eating friend. She is a sausage, bacon, fan. She said sausage was a little spicy but all together with the gorgozola cream, perfect. I got the fritto misto.. Perfectly cooked calamari & shrimp! Yum!\n\nThe bread could easily be an app that customers could pay for (hey! I can appreciate a complimentary bread app, but I work in the food business, I understand food and labor cost). The side seasoning tray that comes with the bread -- that marscapone lemon cream -- only Giada would think of that! Yum! The fried capers, I loved and put it in my salmon dish. It was tasty!!\n\nEntrees: my friend got the pasta e figioli and the corn and sausage side. (She also ate the dates and she was stuffed) I don't eat meat so I couldn't taste any of it, but rave reviews and portion size great.\n\nMy pan seared salmon & summer succotash. I was in heaven. My favorite dish of all time. What a great combination of flavors. Salmon cooked perfectly (medium, thank you). The edamame and corn was cooked perfectly, the worst is soft edamame, not this one-- perfect! That whole grain mustard sauce, light and delicious. I want to know what else is in that! I'm sure I will have dreams of this dish until I can make my way back to Vegas to have it again. Side of potatoes, Giada must know my love for potatoes well. Smashed then fried, topped with parm and lemon zest -- fantastic!!!\n\nDessert: peanut butter and jelly tiramisu -- wow, just wow. Light and airy cream, mellow PB flavor. Amazingly delicious. My second fave was the lime & blackberry. Flavors are amazing together. \n\nPolenta cake with strawberries. Seriously, what's in that strawberry sauce? I am not the biggest strawberry fan, but if someone put that in front of me, I would not turn down a bite. I was expecting the polenta cake to be .. Hmm maybe grainy, dense? But NO! Light, airy, yum!!!!!\n\nI also tried an espresso, nutella shot drink. I am an espresso lover, that drink needs to be served in a latte cup cause that was just a tease :)\n\nI can't wait til I can come back. Sad Giada left the night before we had dinner, but so glad when the boss is away they still can keep everything up to par.

I'm their number one freaking fan. Where do I start? \n\nLocation and History: inside the historic Clarendon Hotel. If you don't know the story of Don Bolles -- the Arizona Republic reporter who was murdered by the PHX mafia in the hotel's parking lot -- then acquaint yourself on some crazy PHX background. The hotel has some (rather poorly enlarged, unfortunately) newspaper clippings and photos on this throughout its hallways that lead to the bathroom. Anyway, look up the story, then drop some knowledge on your fellow diners -- they will certainly appreciate the space on a whole new level.\n\nFood: Reasonably priced and yum-yum. Tortas, street-style tacos, Mexi brunch, dessert (fresh fruit and crema is light, sweet and perfect end to, say, a giant carna asada burrito), I love it all. I cannot rave enough about their Ejote, or Mexican Grilled Corn. I make everyone I take here try it and have turned them all into addicts. Not to mention, their food is from local farms and much of it is organic...say, what?? For the price, the taste and the guilt-free experience, you simply cannot beat it. I have one note of warning, do NOT get sucked into the curiosity surrounding their Chicharron de Queso (which comes with the quip on their menu: \"This is NOT a quesadilla, gringos\"). It's basically fried cheese. Sounds so simple and weird that you think Well, it must be more than it sounds, to be on the menu! Nope, it tastes just like the bits of shredded cheese that fall out of your grilled cheese onto the skillet and get half burnt. But everything else I've tried gets a thumbs up. \n\nLive entertainment and extras: Flamenco music and dancing demos every Wednesday = awesome. Held inside the lobby (viewable from most seats in the dining room) or on the roof when it's cooler. Sunday cool baby night -- DJs and hipster mingling on the roof, complete with makeshift bar.\n\nOdds and Ends: The pool area and roof top. Pool area is fantastic with its brightly colored tile, water wall of glass and cacti. Soothing, beautiful and a great spot for out-of-towners to relax. Not to mention the City of Phoenix logo sculpture, which, as Bonnie G pointed out, is a great spot to snag photos with your visiting friends and family. The roof top area is just perfect -- a great view of the city, tons of comfy padded patio furniture. \n\nBetween getting to tell newcomers about the cool history, take them up to the roof and introduce them to the Valley's best Ejote, this is my top \"hidden gem\" in Phoenix. I take my parents here and I take dates here, it's just that versatile and cool.  As such: Number. One.

There was one cook and that was it for the staff. \n\nFrom the time we walked in and sat down, no one greeted us, no one brought us a menu or a drink or took our order...no one ever came to the table.

The first was a 3 meat sampler and a pulled pork sandwich.  The 3 meats were burnt ends, brisket and St. Louis ribs.  Sides were the greens, fries and potato salad.\n\nWhen I got home I noticed that there was absolutely no sauce whatsoever.  NONE.  Nothing on the side, nothing on the meats, nothing on the sandwich.  Pulled pork with no BBQ sauce?\n\nAnyway, the pulled pork was fairly good about the same quality as Memphis.  The brisket was okay but not outstanding.  I thought the St. Louis ribs were fairly good but not memorable.\n\nPotato salad was a good yellow mustardy variety but the fries were poor.  They looked well seasoned but the only thing that came through was the sugar.  Greens didn't have much flavor, almost watery.  \n\nI really liked the burnt ends.  They were very large pieces about 2 inches square with plenty of char and fat flavor.  My girlfriend did not like the piece she sampled.  She spit it out actually because it had a very large chunk of fat.  However, I loved the flavor enough to forgive them for forgetting the sauce.  They were so good I gave them another chance.\n\nRound II\n\nThe second time, I got another pulled pork sandwich and the 3 meat sampler.  However, this time I was told that you can't select St. Louis style for the 3 meat even though I got it the last time.  I went for the brisket, sausage and burnt ends.\n\nThe sides ordered this time were the cucumbers, potato salad and potato salad.  Yes, I do like their potato salad so it is a deliberate repeat.\n\nThe sausage was a bit odd.  It was grayish inside from a lot of sage and dry.  It was poor especially compared to Salt Lick.\n\nBrisket was dry this time.  Previously it was acceptable quality but not this time.\n\nMy burnt ends were also worse than the first visit.  Instead of big pieces that perfectly balanced char with fat, the pieces were sometimes no thicker than a half inch.  I liked a few pieces but some of them were just plain bad with the wrong ratio of char to fat flavor.\n\nI made sure to emphasize that we wanted a lot of extra sauce.  They told me over the phone that they had 3 kinds and that I was going to get plenty of each.  When I picked it up I made sure to ask about the sauce and they confirmed that we had lots.  Alas, no happy ending.\n\nWhen I got home, I noticed that they used some decently large containers for the sauce.  They were not labeled but that was no problem. \n\nIt's easy to tell sweet from hot and vinegary, etc.  Except that each of the 6 containers were the same sauce.  Yes, the same one in each of those 6 different containers.  Good vinegary sauce but NO variety.\n\nPros:\n\n1.  Sometimes burnt ends are excellent if you like char and fat flavor\n2.  Potato salad is good\n3.  Waitresses wear short skirts\n\nCons:\n\n1.  Inconsistent quality\n2.  Below average sausage\n3.  Take-out orders are not suggested.  Be there so you can complain until they get it right.\n\nI might repeat simply because of the first experience with their burnt ends.

We told her that was unacceptable and to please send him to our table. In the next five minutes, he stormed by our table at least twice but never stopped, he pointedly ignored us. She came back and told us he was in a \"bad mood\" so she removed the $12 drink from the tab anyway. My guess is she gets docked $12 or fired.\n\nDon't give this half-baked operation ANY of your money.

The food is fantastic, which is why I keep going back; however, I feel they do not run their restaurant properly. Their AYCE Korean BBQ is definitely their best asset and a great deal! The variety they offer for AYCE is generous and it's a great way to have a group dinner..... which is WHY I took my friends from LA here the other night, but they weren't offering AYCE because of the convention! She explained that during convention days, it's not an option. I also went there to order their jjambbong (my all-time favorite dish that's both Chinese and Korean), and they said their Chinese menu is limited to before 10pm. It was disappointing to be a hostess and show off a place I loved so much, only to be limited to the typical, overpriced Korean menu.... they have all these strict rules where they can't serve something a certain way, or you can't take the jjigae from AYCE home when it's actually not refillable, and extra rice costs $... these are all not how I portray a great Korean restaurant. Korean service is usually a lot more generous and flexible to your liking, and needless to say.. I was disappointed with the operations of this place. Also, they were not generous with the banchan (side dishes) either. The raw crab that I LOVE was not provided... it was more of a \"limited\" selection, all because of the convention that was going on. A restaurant should actually put its best foot forward in times of good business... and they most certainly did not. \n\nThe jjambbong for me was \"tied\" with the one from Elephant Snack next door, which so far are my favorite jjambbongs in Vegas. They still don't compare to the ones you can find in Los Angeles or NYC, so once again, I'm still on the hunt. If anyone has recommendations, please let me know!\n\nUnless you're going as a group during a time when they provide AYCE BBQ, there are other Korean restaurants in Vegas I prefer that are more affordable, flexible, and the service is much friendlier.", "business_id": "DTtIi7avC0Ed-tMZAAx4wA", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-03-03", "type": "review"}

Both were good; I love how the pretzels are served with a trio of dipping sauces - honey mustard, queso, and yellow mustard - and how they are not too salty, but have just enough salt on them to avoid being bland.

Got us the right pizza pretty quickly & asked us to keep the incorrect pizza. Initially, he had also discounted the pizzas for us which was very exceptional as well. The only thing I didn't like about the pizza, all of them, was that the bottom was so burnt. Just not my bag.

I could not finish my plate, that is saying something.  \n\nWhat made this experience amazing was our waiter, Jose S.   I have had good service in the past, but Jose S went over and above all expectations!  Not only did he gladly ask questions of the chef regarding dietary questions that I had, but he when the computer told him that they did not have the item I desired, he took the extra step and checked.  Who would have thunk it?  The computer was wrong (even though two other waiters came by and told my table that they were out of fried chicken.)  \n\nThe waiter can make an ok meal great, or make a great meal terrible (see my review of Nundini's.)

I used to work at the Melting Pot in the U.S. and so I wanted to take my girlfriend to a nice fondue restaurant while we were vacationing in Montreal, as it was her birthday. Everything was so perfect and so tasty!\nWe were sat in a nice little table near the back of the restaurant.  It was a small dining room, but still managed to fit many tables and guests in it, and yet it didn't feel crowded.  The waiters were incredibly nice and attentive.  I drank my water extremely fast the whole meal and they always refilled it promptly.\nWe ordered La Romantique for the both of us along with a glass of the Bordeaux Superieur each.  We chose pink peppercorn for our cheese, which we needed to say because when we ordered they didn't ask us what options we wanted, which we thought was odd.  The meat (shrimp, salmon, calamari, chicken and beef) was all so fresh-tasting and high-quality.  All the sauces were well-flavored and yet not too overpowering.\nFinally... the moment we were waiting for arrived.... CHOCOLATE fondue!  The chocolate was so delicious and the dippers were excellent! (bananas, pineapples, grapes, apples and marshmallows)\nBetween each course they were fast to come to us and clear, and quick to deliver the next course.  The ambiance and level of service was very pleasant.  My only wish is that I lived here in Montreal so that I could come back more often!

Our waitress was swamped with a full house when we arrived so we didn't mind that it took her a long time to give us menus and water. After people started clearing out and we were one of one two tables dining inside we would have to all three stare her down to try and ask for more water. Which she wouldn't even look at us and just blast by. We would have to shout to get her attention. The first time she returned with the whole pitcher and just said \"Here. I will give you the whole thing.\" Which filled the 3 small cups once. So we had to again shout at her after she would walk past us twice without acknowledging us. \n\nLastly, the bill comes and we ask her to split it since we all only have cards. She then informs us that it is cash-only. We were trying to figure out what to do, she points us in the direction of an ATM and storms off rolling her eyes.\n\nThere is no sign anywhere that says they do no accept cards.

At this time, the restaurant was semi-busy but it got to be quite loud and packed around 8:30-9. Avoid going at these times if you would like to hear anyone speak at your table.\n\nWe were brought a menu with the dishes we would be served that evening, and were poured our complimentary champagne. A plate of margarita pizza was the first to arrive was fairly tasty. Cracker-thin crust and a very light spread of tomato sauce and cheese. Following it was a meat and cheese plate, calamari, and gnocchi with a meat ragu. I don't eat pork and don't prefer calamari and so I avoided those, but the gnocchi were very light and delicious. \n\nFor mains, we had salmon with spinach, and chicken parmigiana.  The salmon was very delicious and I really enjoyed having spinach as a side as there weren't any other vegetables throughout the meal. The chicken was blah. Very saucy. Tough meat. Blah. While portions looked to be on the small side for 2 people, there was no way we could get through all of this. \n\nService was amazing throughout our meal. Our water glasses were never less than 1/2 full and plates were quickly bused off our table as soon as we put our forks down. My sister joined us at the restaurant and ordered separately and was very delighted with her meal.\n\nIt's true that they minus what the original cost of what the meal would have been, from your bill. So you get a bill that is $320 and then they credit your voucher and you pay tax and tip on top. Not the best procedure as my heart certainly flipped when I saw $320 on there, but they take care of you and it's a lovely meal.\n\nA word of caution not to use this deal on a Sunday evening. We did and figured we would just go to Ghostbar to check out the view. Low and behold, it was closed for a private event and so we lost out on that portion of the deal.

Of course they have a bunch of beer signs, TVs, Megatouch games and all that. Their bathrooms are better than one would expect.

After all I had many reasons to fear the unknown: located at the west end of Princes Street, on the cusp of the dreaded Lothian Road, an area not uncommon to the odd bout of weekend violence; the Haye/Klitschko match had just that minute ended in defeat for the cocky Briton, again another excuse for the drunken, pumped-up chavs of the west end to exert some aggressive testosterone on some unwitting strangers; and of course, my company, a close circle of friends from out of town who, whenever they grace Edinburgh's nightlife scene, choose the cheesiest, most unusually bizarre venues for their escapades, their only criteria seemingly wherever will let them away with the most drunken banter without being asked to leave (see: Jam House, Walkabout and/or Mood!).\n\nSo going in, high hopes I did not have. We first started upstairs. The ceilidh hall or, as I call it, the Medieval Jam House, where after parting with the required \u00a33 entry, we were greeted with the bustling populace and the cheesiest of cheesy live bands. Cheesier than a Kingsize Happy Meal. So cheesy they made Aqua look credible. You get the gist. I've been told on occasion there will are ceilidhs instead of the band, so sounds like I got there on a GOOD night...!\n\nIn fairness, the clientele did make the hall more bearable. A spacious bar area meant less heaving crowds and more social space. Tables a bit crammed together meant it was difficult to manoeuvre in between but the outskirts were fine. And I suppose the band would be tolerable if you were into that kinda thing... or were completely sozzled!\n\nI, however, was not and so sought something more downstairs... and found it.\n\nPerhaps one of the best social bars in Edinburgh. Definitely worth a look. The music was also live, but an acoustic set of rock and indie classics (gotta hand it to young male guitarists in the area... they have no idea what cheese is!) that wasn't overpowering, so there was no struggle to make yourself heard. The space was immense, enough tables and chairs not to let the floor become overcrowded and enough standing room even if all seats were taken, therefore no barging to and from the bar.\n\nThe atmosphere lively, an even ratio of male to female (probably the only bar I can think of in recent weeks where this was the case), a good standard of customer (ie. no chavs, ponces, et al) and attentive bar staff. Didn't notice much price difference between here and anywhere else around the town centre, and no idea if they serve food.\n\nAll in all a well-maintained, clean and chav-free bar with a busy, lively and albeit cheesy club atmosphere above. Hats off to the bouncers, I will no doubt step through your doors once more and next time that's where I'll leave my trepidation!", "business_id": "g054F0-_WB-J3aufvR9XBA", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-07-05", "type": "review"}

We sat at the sushi bar to check out the variety and quality of fish, which was alright. The variety was the typical sushi staples and not much more. This didn't really seem like a place to get sashimi or plain sushi so we ordered rolls instead. I thought the Brazilian and Japanese fusion was very interesting.

I mean, I eat from some grimy burrito places, and their food is AMAZING compared to the stuff they're passing off as food here. Maybe it's because we went late, but either way I decided to play it safe and order a bean and cheese burrito that I could barely eat five bites of before completely giving up on it. Others in my party ordered the carne asada burrito (oh, I should mention that I was the only sober one here-everyone in my party was absolutely sloshed), and most of them ate all of it, but later told me how bad it was and what a bad idea it was to eat it. They said they would have much rather gone to a good place (which I agreed with!), and collectively we all agreed never to come here again. \n\nNext time you see the Julio's Too shuttle driver pass by, ask him for a ride to the nearest GOOD Mexican place!

In fact, I am pretty disappointed that this has taken the title of \"Best Thai Restaurant in Vegas,\" as far as tourists are concerned.  I am trying to find a good reason to give LoS 3 stars, but unfortunately I just can't.\n\nI went on a whim with some coworkers, and we ordered a fairly wide range of food.  We had the Tom Kha Kai, Pad see ew, Rad Na pork, northern red curry chicken, and the desert platter.  I'll go from the best to the worst of these dishes, and why I wasn't impressed with most of them.    \n\nThe best dish was the dessert platter.  It came with a single excellent mango, sliced and perfectly sweet.  I loved it.  The platter also came with 2 excellent fried bananas, a clump of nicely prepared sweet sticky rice, and a scoop coconut ice cream.  All of it was great, and was by far the best part of the meal.  The only downside was that it was a bit overpriced at $13.95.\n\nNext up was the Rad Na with pork.  I would have been very impressed with this dish if it weren't for the over-ripe Chinese broccoli... more on that broccoli later.  The gravy sauce was actually very good; I was impressed!  It had a nice, somewhat unique taste with a perfect consistency.  The noodles and the pork were averagely prepared.  Overall, if the broccoli wasn't over-ripe, it would have been a pretty good dish.  \n\nThe first dish we had was the Tom Kha Kai.  It had spices that I haven't seen before in this dish, which made it interesting.  Careful sipping this, I nearly choked on a pepper that went down the wrong pipe!  It had a red chili sauce floating above the coconut milk that gave it a nice spicy bite.  I haven't had Tom Kha Kai from a lot of different places, but I have had excellent versions of this dish.  This one was pretty average, however.  The coconut milk seemed a bit watery, resulting in a less than potent taste.  I think that most people would be pleased with this dish, but I've had better.  \n\nNext was the pad see ew, which was more disappointing than the Rad Na.  The over-ripe Chinese broccoli really ruined the entire dish for us.  I felt like the broccoli was a bit skimpy as well with small, few pieces.  I *love* fresh Chinese broccoli with thick, crunchy stems.  I *hate* over-ripe, bitter Chinese broccoli.  This really is a pet peeve of mine.  The Chinese broccoli made the Rad Na a less-than perfect dish, but it downright ruined the pad see ew.  Knowing that LoS doesn't care about stocking fresh Chinese broccoli, I would suggest skipping anything on the menu that has this ingredient.    \n\nOn to the joke of the meal, the Northern Red Curry.  How about poorly prepared chicken broth with some hot chili in it?  It was spicy, but still very bland over the white rice.  I was extremely bored with this dish, which was a surprise because I've heard that the Northern dishes are the dishes to get at LoS.  Maybe we were unlucky.  Do yourself a favor, and don't order this.  \n\nAll of that said, I have never had better service at a Thai restaurant that I wasn't good friends with the manager.  The servers really put out some effort to give you the feel that you are in a gourmet restaurant.  They filled our soup bowls, and constantly topped up our water glasses. The staff was very friendly, and extremely professional.  The wine rack is impressive, and adds to the gourmet feeling as well.  If only the food was also gourmet.\n\nIf your pallet for Thai food hasn't been lucky enough to taste really great Thai, this place isn't a bad one to go to as a tourist.  If you are a local, or you are someone who has a more refined taste in Thai food, there are lots of better Thai restaurants in Las Vegas.", "business_id": "lliksv-tglfUz1T3B3vgvA", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-08-30", "type": "review"}

The owner is behind the sushi bar, which is a huge plus. We got a sashimi platter which comes with 15 BIG pieces of fresh sashimi for just $25. I honestly don't know how they can make a profit out of this because all their fish was imported straight from Japan. With the same quality of sashimi, I paid $150 in Chicago. The $15 twin dragon roll is super delicious and filling. The service here is awesome, too. The executive chef and servers are super friendly.

So during our recent vacation trip to Utah over the 4th of July weekend, I made sure to add Vegas to our Itinerary and pay homage to Bacchanal.\n\nAs a frequent gambler, I always make sure to take advantage of the Casino comps, especially Caesar's total rewards program. Membership does have its advantage and rewards. I was able to avoid the general line and go to the diamond and seven stars member line without waiting, avoiding the 40-60 minute wait. Without it I suggest getting here 1 hour early before the lunch time or dinner rush hours.\n\nLike most of the high end buffet places in Vegas, expect to pay around $40-$50. Sure you can go elsewhere, but I can assure your $50 buffet price of admission and food indulgence at Bacchanal will be memorable and delicious. For an even better deal upgrade to 24hr Buffet of Buffets for an additional $25 more and a great value.\n\nTypical of most buffet style restaurants atmosphere is bustling. The decor inside is eclectic and modern including chic dessert section. The ceiling is actually surrounded and framed in unique glass pattern which is very inspiring and beautiful.\n\nAs for the food, there buffets has one of the largest and freshest selections of food in town. Make sure to pace yourself and take small bites or taste to truly enjoy all that Bacchanal has to offer. Everything is set up in stations that represent different styles of cuisine and offerings - Meat, seafood, desserts, Italian, fried foods, Mexican, Japanese and Asian.\n\nSeafood -\n* Snow king crab legs - cold and heated options. Meat was a bit skimpy, but at least they were served in half allowing easy access.\n* Jumbo shrimps - huge size and more like prawns.\n* Clam bake - comes in cute little baskets - filled with clams, sausages and corn.\n* Ceviche - raw fish served in a small shot glass and marinated in lime juice, onions, cilantro and avocado - delicious and refreshing.\n* Salmon with cherry tomato - so tender and flavorful.\n* Bouchot mussels - white wine sauce, parsley, and served sourdough crostini was fabulous.\n\nAsian Food - Vast choices and selections that will make you feel that you're in Chinatown and Little Tokyo. The Peking duck and kalbi beef were so succulent and delicious.\n\nBBQ Meats - the best and extensive meat spread I've seen in all of Vegas. Lamb chops, prime rib, Tomahawk rib eye steaks, beef brisket, sausages - cooked perfectly, well seasoned and all delicious.\n\nDesserts section - Outstanding desserts and a perfect ending to an exceptional meal.  \n* Ice Cream and Gelato - Balsamic figs and baklava - OMG so incredibly delicious!\n* Cream br\u00fbl\u00e9e - preferred regular version over the chocolate (more like a chocolate pudding). Perfectly caramelized top layer crust and rich vanilla custard makes one awesome treat.\n* Souffle - so downright decadent and amazing.\n* Tiramisu - served in chocolate cup which you can devour and feel happy afterwords - \"Yummilicious!\"\n* Macarons - lightly crisp exterior shell, soft and chewy inside. Tasted so heavenly. My favorites were the pistachio and mocha.\n* Crepe station - fresh strawberry drizzled with chocolate and dusted with powder sugar always does it for me and scrumptious.\n\nMexican - \n* Street food taco section was a fabulous idea and reminded me of the succulent tacos in LA served from Food trucks. Accompanied with a vast selection of bottled salsa and hot sauces, the carne asada and al pastor tacos were solid.\n* Posole - delicious Mexican pork soup includes all your fresh accoutrement's\n* Whole grilled Mexican corn with butter and queso fresco was outstanding.\n\nSalads - watermelon and feta served in small square glass dish was refreshing and delightful. Just the presentation alone had me salivating. The Caprese salad was excellent as well.\n\nFried Food - \n* Fried chicken with sweet potato fries in basket - excellent crispy exterior followed by flavorful tender chicken and well seasoned.\n* Crab croquette - So yummy with actual crab meat inside. Great with a dash of hot sauce.\n* Wagyu beef cheeseburger sliders - were cooked perfectly medium, well season and flavorful\n\nItalian section - \n* Lasagna, pizzas, garlic knots and Rigatoni - Typical and standard, but still satisfying. There pasta dishes needs more dishes and limited.\n\nComplaint - \n* Sushi - Simple and lacking creativity, definitely needs sashimi dishes.\n* For the price of admission, they should include beer, champagne and wine as complimentary item.\n*  No stone crab legs during my recent visit.\n* Long lines at seafood and meat station due to its overwhelming popularity.\n\nOverall - Prompt and attentive service. Our server came by regularly to refill our drinks and take our dirty dishes away. Enjoyed our meal and had a wonderful time stuffing our faces. It's definitely worth checking out, but make sure you come with a big appetite and hungry because the food is overwhelmingly good.", "business_id": "sIyHTizqAiGu12XMLX3N3g", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-07-15", "type": "review"}

It's located inside Caesar's.  Don't be mistaken - there is a Payard Express and a Payard Patisserie.  \n\nThis place is beautifully decorated and pretty similar to Jean Philippe at the Aria/Bellagio.  They have sandwiches, crepes, pastries, coffee, desserts, and other baked goods.  If my stay in Vegas had been longer, I would have tried their crepes.  \n\nAnyhoo, It was about 9:45am when I arrived, and there was a line, but it was moving fairly quickly. I asked the lady behind the counter if she knew which desserts were flourless. I was impressed that since she didn't know, she offered to go inside and ask the store manager.  The store manager wasn't 100% positive either so she also went inside and asked the pastry chef.  After a couple of minutes, she came back and told me that the Sweet Relief and Chocolate Decadence were, indeed, flourless.  I was impressed that they were willing to stop whatever they were doing and confirm for me.  Some places didn't do that, and they shall remain anonymous.    \n\nI ordered both to go and ate the Sweet Relief right away.  It's a giant meringue with pineapple mousse and small chunks of mango inside.  It tasted very light, delicious, and refreshing. I'd definitely get that again.\n\nI ate the Chocolate Decadence later that night, and it was pretty good.

Black Angus Original Wineburger with a side of Onion \"scoops\".  The Scoops are awesome little beer battered-deep fried onion slices and are better than any onion rings I've ever had.  I ordered my Wineburger with swiss cheese, green chilis and bacon and it did not disappoint.  The meat was tasty and tender, the bun was buttery and soft and everything came together beautifully.\nThis is definitely a place you would drive by without noticing, or even avoid if you saw it from the outside.  But inside, it holds a wonderful menu of tasty goodness and I can't wait to go back and try something from the \"Chili Section\" of the menu!", "business_id": "CNvPqN9pa5aJRn-Npcqgdg", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-10-10", "type": "review"}

Finally decided to pay a visit while staying at the El Cortez across the street. \n\nOnce inside, I was immediately struck by the size of the place. It's at least five times larger than I imagined from passing by outside. Before this, it always seemed like the guests were crammed into the front part of the shop, surrounded by glass on two sides of the building. Whenever I walked by and peered at the coffee-slurpers, I felt like I was passing an aquarium and should drop some food inside.\n\nBut my impressions after visiting are completely different. This is a place I can't compare to any other. If I had to attempt to describe it, I'm just going to date myself. Okay so here goes: It's kind of like Record & Tape Traders meets Starbuck's meets local art gallery.\n\nSee? Half of you probably don't even know what Record & Tape Traders is. But this is good. It means you've got your youth. Please use it responsibly.\n\nThe Beat is more than just a great place to grab coffee. It's a world unto itself. Sure, there's all kinds of excellent coffee. And food. But there's also an art gallery with some truly stunning pieces of work. There's a very large upstairs, too. So don't forget that if you decide to venture into the art realms. Adding to the vibe here, there are some cool classics being piped through the speakers and vinyl albums right there in the shop. Remember those?\n\nStaff is very upbeat, friendly and professional. One even told me I smelled good right after I placed my order. Did I? Probably. My secret? MK High Intensity Cologne. And yes I have a Mary Kay rep. But hey, what a compliment to go with your coffee. \n\nThis is a place where laptops and tablets abound. Deals are done, Tony Hsieh of Zappos grabs his morning fix, and introductions are made several times in one morning. I only know this because I grabbed a seat at a table, fired up my laptop, and blended in with the morning crowd.\n\nAnd what an eclectic crowd it is. All kinds hang out here. The well-heeled, the working class like me, and some who had clearly just stolen their ipads from someone. A tourist, no doubt. But at least they have good taste in coffee shops.\n\nWhile not exactly off the beaten path, the Beat Coffeehouse is less touristy than say, the Starbuck's' or Seattle's Bests you'll find on the Strip or under the Fremont Canopy. It's more of a locals joint and a very fun place to grab your morning jolt, or even just to visit. Just one more fixture that makes downtown worth whatever it takes to get you there.", "business_id": "-GZsHVDlI6wvLsgD1Yaj0g", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-12-23", "type": "review"}

This last visit to the restaurant, I learned something very important and that is when you see a not-so-recently deceased clown fish on the bench in front of the aquarium where you would presumably wait to be seated or sit to view the otherwise lively aquatic environment, laugh and exit the establishment immediately. Don't sit there and continue to order a feast, no, don't. \n\nI, stupidly, was able to stop peering at and laughing about the highly visible dried up and flat dead clown fish for long enough to order way too much food. Our server was new and did not know Indian food, at all. We had to slowly repeat and point to what we wanted; neither English nor any of the many Indian languages were her first language, poor girl - she probably knew about the fish - we imagined her internal struggle over what to do about it...it being her first day and all, worrying about whether she should tell anybody for fear she will be blamed or yelled at or forced to touch it, or maybe she should just pick it up already and get it out of sight, but then what if somebody sees her and attention is brought to the fact that there is indeed a dead fish and that a person who is also handling food is handling a rotting fish...\n\nSooo, enough with Finding Nemo and on to the deplorable food. We ordered vegetable samosas as our appetizer. They were flatter and smaller than the typical samosa, scantily spiced, and they seemed to have been frozen and microwaved (hardly) rather than deep fried. They were cold. Not greasy (like I think they should be). The chutneys and mango pickle all had the quality of having been born in a factory, canned, shelved for years, opened last week and sitting out all day before being served to us. I didn't try the papadam because I could tell that that too was cheaply manufactured. For entrees, the two of us shared Baingan Bharta, Aloo Gobi and a Dosa. The Dosa was ice cold, pale white and, well, I never knew they could be frozen without breaking. The sambar that came with it tasted like Campbell's Tomato Soup. The aloo (potatoes) in the aloo gobi tasted as if from a can (can you sense a trend yet?), there wasn't much gobi (cauliflower) and the dish lacked spice and complexity. Although the texture was ok, he flavor of the Baingan Bharta was completely overwhelmed with mustard (I realized that I had noticed this with my previous take out/delivery too - so I think it's the recipe, not a fluke). The rice was basic fluffy white rice, with literally a few cumin seeds in it but nothing else of note. Nothing was garnished with cilantro/coriander leaves, no cardamom pods were found. The naan was the worst I've ever had, and like many components of the meal, contained the essence of the package it emerged from, kinda like frozen pizza dough, nothing much like fluffy, bubbly homemade naan, ok, the shape was about right, albeit too perfect. It also had regular butter (which I dislike and do not eat) on it instead of ghee (which I will tolerate). They were somehow out of garlic naan (Giant Eagle must have been out. of. garlic. naan). \n\nThe only reason I would go back would be to see if the fish is STILL on the bench.", "business_id": "-Xl2R863UWrQEyp4dSzMaA", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-12-26", "type": "review"}

Whether you order the Bacon Fat Heirloom Popcorn (don't fear it, it's awesome) or the chicken and waffles, taste bud satisfaction is the norm at this place. \n\nI think the reason I keep coming back, despite the excellent food and amazing white sangria is the amazing service. Whether it's a busy Saturday night, or an early dinner on a weekday I am continually impressed with their level of knowledge and service at CPH. It's how a restaurant experience should be, and it's consistently amazing, just like the food. A plus also is they offer Gluten-Free options for my celiac sister. Believe me she is very hard to please, but CPH always puts her at ease when it comes to the GF options. Go to CPH and I promise you will not be disappointed.\n\nWhat I love to order: white sangria, original chopped salad, pan seared scallops", "business_id": "MuIXnv7Oq7X3-4aEsp9dDA", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-01-03", "type": "review"}

Why? The food cost is all in the cup, the cost of the cup much exceeds that of a second round on fountain soda and should realistically be available for seconds / refills as a service to customers dining in a restaurant. \n\n-Service suggested staff was no where near a happy group of individuals (excessive sighs, long exhausted stares, disgruntled and impatient tone, with overall disorganization)\n\n-Wait time 10 minuets. Okay so not great, but still acceptable. Probably just seemed too long because we were tired and got our hopes up being number 12 after they called number 11 and then 10, 9, 8, 7,12 ? Okay weird but whatever.\n\n-What I cant get over, the biggest con: a DIRTY DIRTY restaurant. Every booth was disgusting with dirty paper napkins and or cups and each also covered in crumbs. Floor was littered with straw wrappers, cups, and dirty napkins as well. Saw the same staff member walk through a disgustingly dirty area and not attend to or mind the mess. The establishment had 4-5 people visible and working and there was frequently no line. If said staff member had the time to circle around aimlessly, why not wipe the tables, or gee I dont know, sweep? It was obviously not overseen in a rush but a demonstration of poor systems and practice of staff. Bathrooms were dirty too. \n\n\nWould I visit again?\nYes, food did not blow our socks off but wasn't terrible, wouldn't mind exploring the options and beverages on menu, Somewhat of a bargain if you know what to order (aka not anything on a croissant) and hey what can I say, even I get dirty now and again, I hope my second trip will be to a more manicures restaurant, because we don't like to eat dirty now do we.\n\nDecent food, 24 hour sandwich spot, loses a star for service/soda machine and one star for cleanliness, or lack there of.", "business_id": "Xsp9Dy4PQgAssCVk2-f73w", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-06-15", "type": "review"}

The menu online looked interesting. So we made reservations. When we got there there are no instructions that guests with reservations don't have to wait in the line. Oh we'll no biggie. \n\nWell we were seated and pretty much ignored us for 15 minutes. We ordered drinks finally & that was the last time we were provided anything to drink. At the 30 minute mark we got the appetizers. The lukewarm lobster bisque had no lobster at all & 2 ravioli at the bottom of a fairly large bowl. The ceasar salad was one half of a heart of romaine lettuce cut all the way down the middle including the core (yuck). We had to cut that off & then cut up the 'salad' to make it eatable. 45-55 minutes into the meal we get the veal we ordered as the main entree & unfortunately it had an odd taste to it so I couldn't finish mine. The waiter took another 10-15 minutes to even ask how the meal was (mind you we haven't had anything to drink in a while either) and he gave me just enough time to nod but little else. 10 more minutes he comes flying by us and we asked for the tab but he didn't acknowledge us. However 8 more minutes & he came with the tab & mentioned our Groupon discount dropped off the box. We packed up like lightening and left a pathetic tip for pathetic service. I felt bad because I know how much the tips mean but I hardly saw this guy. The service was way too long, no refills on our drinks, and even the GM looked right at us as we were getting more & more frustrated with the service and never once came over. I can honestly see no reason to go back to this place as the service was 1 star, the quality was 2 stars and nothing on the menu seemed really stand out (that you couldn't get a more excellent option elsewhere).", "business_id": "JS9Bao1vDxM2BGWMYjEavA", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-09-26", "type": "review"}

I especially love their enchiladas.  Can't get enough of them suckers.

Alas, after our visit today at lunch, we were very relieved to enjoy a very nice meal that represented Silvana well. We ordered three wonderful tacos (fish, chicken y chorizo, and shrimp), chile verde, a mole tamale (the mole was AWESOME) and some very tasty guacamole. My husband is a chile verde connoisseur (which means he eats it a LOT) and said the flavors were rich and complex, and better than traditional chile verde. The black beans that came with his chile verde were *clearly* made from scratch, with an unmistakably homemade flavor.  I have yet to determine if we are salt deprived or if restaurants in general err on the side of less salt -- it is a matter of personal taste -- and with a couple of dashes of salt, the flavors of our meal delighted us. \n\nFor full disclosure, we did not have any alcoholic beverages (loved the water with thick, juicy lemon slices...mmm!)  and found that the price of lunch was very reasonable, considering our \"full\" factor when we were finished. My husband and I had been to this location when it was a French bistro (which I really did not like, mostly because of the ambience/layout of the restaurant) but Silvana has done a fantastic job of creating a fun, stylish, and festive atmosphere. I'm looking forward to visiting again!\n\nPS As for the naysayers like Jordan -- who I believe sat behind us at lunch (the guy bitching about the size of the tacos before he even ordered one?) -- sometimes people just bring their unhappiness with them wherever they go...If you want a \"big\" taco for $2, Taco Bell awaits you...", "business_id": "bOB11LVavtN9PWTNwR52Tw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-02-29", "type": "review"}

Happily obliged an early lunch and we certainly beat the impending crowd that tends to form right around lunchtime proper. \n\nThe lunch menu is very quaint. About 7 options that can all be tailored for choice of protein, veggies, level of spice and other accoutrement. Variations of pad thai, soups. rice dishes and mixed veggies. I settled on the pad thai and was thrilled with the result. Baby bok choy, bean sprouts, rice noodles, a spring roll and a delectable dipping sauce. It's a hefty portion for such a cheap lunch, too. I went with 2-star spice and was happy I did. It cleared my sinus cavity with ease. \n\nMy #1 recommendation: order the hot tea. Especially on a cold day. It's a simple oolong/citrus tea that works so well with the food. I'm stoked to come back and order the tea again. \n\nThe service is super friendly, fast, and fun.

The food is flavor-able without being too salty. The sides are homemade which makes them tasty, not like store-bought or out of a can and heated. The meats are smoked daily.\nIt's interesting how many people do not understand the difference between wet and dry bbq. Barbecue preference is largely dictated by whether you like saucy or seasoned meat  Dry barbecue is smoked, while the wet variety is usually cooked in a fire pit. \nAs they say, the secret is in the sauce. Or the rub. And Big Ern uses both which are also homemade. Rubs are typically worked into the meat the night before it's cooked so that the salt can penetrate the cut and tenderize it. But rubs do more than flavor and soften the meat; they also enhance its texture by caramelizing and forming a crispy crust when cooked. Because of the rub's ability to penetrate the meat, fatty cuts like brisket respond well to this type of seasoning. Memphis BBQ is typically a dry barbecue with sauce on the side; in Kansas City and North Carolina, people like their barbecue wet with even more sauce on the side. \n\nThe service is great, and I have been lucky to sit inside on all my visits, because of the temperatures, but, I am sure that the heaters would be turned on, if needed.\n\nThe price to some may be steep, however, go to any fast food restaurant and up-size that meal, and see what you'll pay for heart-attack in a box.\nI only have one negative remark and it's to Lonely D who reviewed on 12/23, I understand that the holidays may be lonely for some, but one who is unemployed, was a 3 meat combo really necessary, if you couldn't really afford it?\n\nOk, another remark to Lonely D. Sorry. French fries, really? i just googled Southern BBQ side dishes and the most common sides are available at Big Ern's. Only one out of 10 sites even listed \"oven-fried\" fries, as a side dish. So I guess, the next time you want to take a \"suicidal\" trip, try McDonald's, i hear they have a form of \"rib\" sandwich (now this is not meant for human consumption).\n\nBig Ern's BBQ is small (meaning a one store location), but a HUGE success!!", "business_id": "uLbr9xXGlB0PkwQMZgGCNA", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-01-01", "type": "review"}

You can also get very tired, very quickly of the long lines at the hedonistic buffets.  Additionally every hotel has soo many restaurants you can easily get lost in the websites and hotel brochures.  Sometimes you just need to explore the mystical Vegas landscape and hunt yourself down some grub. So that's what we did.\n\nAfter a long day of wandering The Las Vegas Strip in the sun, we had worked up quite a hunger.  Originally we had stopped in at Planet Hollywood Hotel & Casino to grab a beverage and to rest our feet for a minute in front of a negative ATM (a slot machine, it's a joke, cause you put money into it.  Get it? You got it.) when we say the giant bright neon sign for YOLO'S Mexican Grill.  \n\nIt appears quaint, yet still very active.  Like a small 10 person house party that gets really out of control.  We checked out the menu, and decided to roll the dice.\n\nIt wasn't too busy inside, maybe 60% capacity, but it was enough that it didn't feel lonely inside.  We were sat near the edge, so we could \"people watch\" the hordes of people stroll by.\n\nThe d\u00e9cor is quite modern, except splattered with neon.  Think of the design style inside Aria, but then have street artists come with buckets of precise neon and accent the whole thing.  Strangely, it works; not like neon did in the 90's\n\nWe began the Yolo's experience with a Margarona; a margarita with a Coronita inserted upside down.  We saw everyone around us drinking it, and said, \"That looks fun, let's try it!\"  I'm not a big margarita person, but it wasn't bad. Wasn't spectacular, but the spectacle of it cranked the \"fun-ness\" level which somehow made it tastier.\n\nWe ordered the Chips & Sales ($3) to start of the meal, both to curb the alcohol and the hunger gained by walking around The Strip for hours.  What came was a mountain of corn chips and a heaping bowl of salsa, almost too much for an appetizer.\n\nImmediately after we indulged the Roasted Vegetable Fajitas ($13) and the Adobo Vegetable Enchiladas ($12).  We immediately realized how na\u00efve we were in ordering an appetizer as the portion sizes of the two mains were enormous.\n\nLike everywhere on the planet that served Mexican food, I had to ask for more tortillas twice (12) and because there was simply SOOO much food to stuff into my gullet.  The vegetables were spiced nicely, not overly salty (as a common Mexican trend) and thankfully there was enough sour cream, salsa, guacamole and cheese (most importantly) to garnish my riotous portion of tortillas.\n\nWe tried both the Mexican rice, and the cilantro rice; the cilantro being my favorite.  It was enough of a palette cleanser to separate the barrage of Mexican flavours.  The black pinto beans were superb, and both made sure we finished the portions.\n\nBy then end, we actually had to force ourselves to stop eating.  We were so full we felt like the blueberry girl from Charlie & The Chocolate factory.  We sat to regain the blood flow to our legs and enjoyed a Bohemia draft, and a Carta Blanca - both imported Mexican brews.\n\nBest of all was the bill, it was easily the least expensive meal we had had in Vegas thus far; yet one of the most satisfying.  Partially due to our significant over indulgence.\n\nWe did end up visiting the negative ATM's immediately after, as the gargantuan \"fullness\" needed a solid 90 minutes before we felt like normal human beings again.", "business_id": "9_HsCjEELmey18A-gTzZKw", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-01-23", "type": "review"}

The first time, less than two years ago, I ordered the chicken shawarma entree (complete with pickled veggies, hummus, garlic sauce, and pita).  Many of the chicken pieces were still uncooked that I could hardly chew it, and some were still blood-red!  When I started to complain about about this to my server, he acted as if no one has ever complained about the food here before.  He left, and he came back with whom I thought was the cook, who had acted even more offended about my accusation of the meat being uncooked.  He mentioned something about how everything is timed perfectly in the oven, but he offered to bring a new dish out.  Twelve minutes later (yes, I time these things), a slightly more cooked dish of chicken was laid out in front of me.  I decided I'd salvage what I could and just chalk it up to a bad day.  My favorite things in that entree were the pickled veggies and the garlic sauce.  Oh my... the garlic sauce!!  \n\nA few days after that, I brought my Mom with me for dinner.  We ordered the lamb kabob entree to share.  She wasn't impressed with the kabobs, since she had Byblos' lamb shanks on the brain (Byblos' lamb is pretty good, we think).  It was official- the hummus here leaves much to be desired.  However, I still thought the garlic sauce was fantastic!  Tastes great with the tabouli/tabouleh (both are correct).\n\nFast-forward many, many months to two days ago, I decided to order take-out for Mom and me- chicken shawarma sandwich, no pickle (tomatoes, lettuce, and garlic sauce in pita); gyro, no pickle, no cucumber sauce (lamb meat and lettuce in pita); and gyro with everything for Mom.  Why did it take me all this time to finally order these sandwiches to-go?  Both types are must-tries: the shawarma is a popular choice of many here, and all it takes is one bite for you to know why.  The sauce and garlic schmear combo is to-die-for!  And one would think that a pita with only lamb meat and lettuce sounds too simple to be so tasty, but it is!  The meat is so moist and tender, you really don't need any condiment.  Trust me.  Heck, don't trust me and order one plain and one with the works and judge them yourself; Most of the sandwiches costs less than $4 each!  \n\nBTW, you may elect to have whole wheat pita instead of the plain normally used.  You may also take Haji-Baba pitas home (made at the Haji-Baba bakery on Apache east of the restaurant); you may find them on the register counter.  \n\nYou may pay for your take-out in advance and then wait for it to be prepared, or you may want to check out the grocery aisles as you're waiting and pay for everything at the end.  I suggest the chocoholics check out the Swiss chocolate bars here!  I've tried a few brands, and I just love the Milka brand: milk chocolate with whole hazelnut, milk and creamy white layered, plain milk chocolate.  (I love dark chocolate, but couldn't find one allergen-free.)  The flavors are so creamy and you can definitely taste the great quality ingredients used.  There are cheaper brands sold here, but a not-so-quick glance (you may or may not find English among the five or so languages listed on the back) will reveal that other vegetable fat, not cocoa butter, is used.  Go for the \"good chocolate\" brands; At two dollars or less a bar, you can leave with a goodie cache without having to spend much cash.  \n\nYou'll most likely find something in the grocery you'll want to buy, so don't forget to remember to pick up your take-out order.  The chances of you forgetting about food, however, are slim since that is all you'll be thinking of the moment you walk into the place... the food aromas are mouth-watering!", "business_id": "6oRAC4uyJCsJl1X0WZpVSA", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-11-12", "type": "review"}

I've been skeptical about trying here because of how empty the plaza it's in always is. Not gonna lie, with the beat up sign and empty parking lot, it makes you wonder how good it really is. I saw on yelp that it had great reviews though and trying to find real korean food in henderson is practically nonexistent. I was craving yukgaejang like crazy so I gave in and I'm sure glad I did.\nMy husband and I ordered yukgaejang (spicy beef and veggie soup), bindaeduk (korean pancake) and of course their famous meat jun. It all came out to $30 and they give you really good banchan with everything. I read on a previous review that the portions were small. Maybe when you eat there it might be, idk, but ordering for take out the portions were definitely no where near small. We didn't even finish everything besides the meat jun (which my husband devoured). They give you a lot of rice with your orders. Also, I'm pretty sure they gave us about 3 large slices of the pancake but I can't be certain because we ate them so quickly and had about one slice left. The yukgaejang was perfectly spicy and still really hot by the time I got home. Their banchans (side dishes) were spot on as well.\nAlthough most of the better korean restaurants are within Chinatown or near commercial center, I'm so incredibly relieved that I don't have to go all the way there if I'm craving korean food.

The food was well-prepared and tasty - though a little pricey for the amount you get. I would recommend the wood fired pizza (called \"South of the Border\") which was decent size and flavorful and the Blind Pig salad.  The lounge feel was nice and it wasn't too crowded so you could have a good conversation and enjoy your drink/dinner.\n\nIn terms of areas for improvement, there were a few. They need to tweak the menu to give better value (portion to price) on some items and to right-size other items.  (I can't believe they don't have a small side salad that you can order with a main dish.) The serving staff needs to gain a little more experience as they seemed shaky and unfamiliar with some of the menu items. Lastly, beware of the drink sizes! I ordered a glass of wine and received a 3oz pour - about half what you'd expect from a lounge/bar but at full bar prices.  I asked the server about it and she said it was just an illusion because of the glass size - I don't think so!\n\nAs they're still pretty new, I'll cut them some slack but they need to work out some of the kinks.

Overall I'd give it 4 stars, but I'm rounding up.  I'm weighing pretty heavily (at least a full star) for the organic, local menu.\n\nAtmosphere was pleasant, bright and open.  Service was friendly, with a polite waitress and reasonable serving times.\n\nAppetizers: We got classic hummus with pita bread, and vegan spinach and artichoke dip.  The former was very plain, even a sprinkle of paprika on top would have helped a lot.  Possibly our own fault for ordering classic, rather than an interesting flavor.  The latter was actually very good, and I'm hard to please when it comes to fake dairy.  I would have been happy with two of those.\n\nEntrees: Each couple got a wrap to share.  My friend and her boyfriend ordered a veggie wrap, and confirmed that it would come cut in half.  They both enjoyed it, commented on the flavors, and identified a plethora of veggies in the wrap.  Each half was also huge, so they were glad to have split it.  My boyfriend and I got the chicken shawarma wrap and failed to confirm if it would be served cut in half (though we did make it clear we'd be sharing).  It came in a sort of overflowing taco situation, wrapped in foil.  The waitress wished us luck in splitting it, as she dropped it off.  Oh thanks.  We passed it back and forth taking bites.  It was pretty tasty though.\n\nBeverages: I got a strawberry lemonade, my friend got a pomegranate iced tea, and the guys had water.  The lemonade was good, but it had a sort of \"artificial sweetener\" after-taste that was disappointing.  My friend said her tea tasted more like a good green-tea than anything fruity.  She wasn't complaining, but it wasn't what she expected.\n\nThe bill: Prices are going to be higher when the food is organic and locally grown.  I'm willing to pay more for that if that's what I'm after, but considering we weren't entirely impressed by our half of the meal, it felt like a lot.  Our friends were a lot more satisfied since they thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of their meal, and are more willing to pay for organic food.  $20 for lunch for two people isn't bad, but considering we shared everything and didn't feel like it was spectacular, this won't likely be a regular spot for us.

My girlfriend likes this place and I like to see her happy, so we go often.  This is her favorite Korean restaurant in Vegas, where we live.  There is plenty of parking.  The atmosphere is pretty cool.  We always sit in a booth.  Each booth has walls that go all the way up creating privacy and a sense if intimacy.  The servers are friendly, helpful, and clean.  Korean pop music and a little Korean rap provide additional cultural ambiance.  Popcorn tea is served before you order.  Its a little weird, but definitely reminds me of popcorn.  Various side dishes come out with every meal.  A lot of pickled stuff.  The only one I can name is kimchi.  My girlfriend loves the hot kimchi soup.  I'm starting to like it too.  I like to pour it over rice.  By the way, they never seem to give me enough rice.  My favorite entree here is the galbi.  Probably because it is closest to stuff I normally eat.  It is BBQ ribs sliced very thin and served on grilled vegetables on a hot skillet.  The bulgogi is also pretty good.  Thin sliced meat served in a soup.  We ordered the fried calamari once.  It was pretty good, but had a lot of garlic.  Once we tried Korean style sushi.  It was okay.  Another time we tried a seafood soup.  It sounded so good.  It had all sorts of seafood.  However, the meat was too hard to get to.  It was really messy so I gave up.  I was really disappointed.  The plates, bowls, and eating utensils are all very stylish.  I really enjoy experiencing other cultures and love trying their foods.  I'm beginning to like Korean food more and even developing a taste for kimchi.

I toyed between two and three stars, but the two star description of \"meh, I've experienced better\" perfectly encapsulates how I felt about this meal. \n\nWe started with an appetizer of potato croquettes.  Fried potatoes with gooey cheese in the middle, can't go wrong, right?  Wrong.  The cheese was practically frozen, no exaggeration.  Not just not warm or melted, but literally seemed as if it had just come out of the freezer.  \n\nFor my meal, I had the rigatoni alla vodka.  This dish was good, but it had been smothered in parmagiano cheese that I tasted for the next twelve hours despite brushing my teeth three times.  Jen had a linguine with mussels and clams that she said was delicious. \n\nWhat is almost bizarre about this restaurant is the decor and atmopshere.  The white tile floors and mostly bare walls don't match the menu or what you'd expect from a smallish Italian restaurant and instead look like the restaurant recently transitioned from serving fast food.  Perhaps they're not finished decorating? \n\nThe service was attentive and friendly and the Market Square location is great, so I'll more likely than not give La Cucina Flegrea another try in a few months.", "business_id": "q_CxEcRcAR5LVU8ZzftVDQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-01-16", "type": "review"}

I was very disappointed.  I was there around 6pm tonight (Friday).  I was going to order ribs but they were sold out, so I ordered brisket and sausage.   The brisket was moist and had ok taste; however, it was chopped and most of it was fat, not meat.  I took one bite of the sausage and almost lost it all.  Something wasn't right about the taste.  Needless to say, I didn't take another bite to give it a second chance.  I purchased two classic meals, wich come with two sides.  I ordered the beans and mac & cheese with one meal, and mashed potatoes and coleslaw with the other.  The beans were old and had a scorched taste to them. The mac & cheese was dry and had no taste.  The coleslaw might have been good but I wouldn't know, because it was served in the same container as the rest of the meal. By the time I got home, it was warm :-(.   The mashed potatoes had no taste and were old too.  My friend that I was sharing with actually ordered pizza instead.  She could not stomach to eat anything from this place.  I was albe to salvage somewhat of the meal by putting the brisket on top of the mash potatoes.  This made the meal tolerable.   I don't recall ever leaving such a bad review for any restaurant but I've never had food that was as bad as I've had tonight.

Very trendy, though not a place you want to linger for hours as you'll be sat next to somebody else and you can't lean back at all!  Cash only as well.\n\nI can't find a menu online, but I remember that it was full of really unusual offerings.  Not just the usual curries you see anywhere, there were lots of ingredients I'd never heard of in fascinating combinations.  We both went for the Kuay Tiaw Nam Tak Nua (under the Soup Bowl section) and added noodles for \u00a31.  Apparently noodles aren't traditional in this soup, but I'd recommend them!  This is a flavorful, herbal soup with beef broth and extremely tender meat (though not quite enough of it).  We also shared a few snacks - a side of stir-fried veggies (which were oddly delicious, they were cooked very gently in a very delicate sauce and were a vast improvement over the usual bland steamed affair) and an unusual side of calamari and prawns in a sweet-sour sauce with some crispy crackers in.  I didn't really \"get\" that one, it wasn't what i'd pictured.  Felt like proper street food, lots of things all blended together in a box with strong flavors, but it was a bit of an odd combo!  Our soup came in bowls, but all the other dishes came in little cardboard boxes that look like they're meant for takeaway, which is a cute little touch.  Oh, and we got a lemongrass ginger juice - and hated it.  So sticky and sweet and strange.  Fiance said it tasted like squash (not like, butternut...the concentrated juice syrup that you can get in the UK) and we left it almost untouched.\n\nIt's a very cheap place to get a meal!

They are warm and fresh most of the time. They tend to only serve them after 4pm, but sometimes they will \"go out of their way\" and scrounge some up if you ask for them around lunch time. \nWhen they have clam chowder, order it. It is surprisingly really good! If you are from back east and \"know\" your clam chowder, don't expect that, but expect a soup that's flavorful and really good.\nBreakfast (available on weekends only) is cheap, or at least really affordable! You get a good quantity of food for the price. Quality of breakfast food? That's more 3 1/2 star because it's good, not great.\n\nThree (and a half stars):\nFood value. Food is pretty good, but I feel that some of the entrees tend to be $1-2 overpriced. This adds up when you order drinks and appetizers. It's a better deal when you order from their bar menu. They have decent burgers and their super nacho plate is my husband's favorite thing to order every time we go there. Since we live in the Vistancia neighborhood, it's a 2 minute drive over to Trilogy here at Verde Grill, so when we are lazy we just come here and have super nachos and I order their fish tacos. The fish tacos themselves are tasty, but I think they are still trying to figure out their fish taco sides since it's been slightly different each time - a few times, it came with rice and beans and the other few times it came with chips and salsa. \nMy go-to order used to be their Steak salad with blue cheese crumbles. This was from March 2010 when we starting going there until this past fall. I guess to make it healthier, they now changed this steak salad to a vinegarette dressing and it is plainer than it used to be, so I don't order it anymore. The blue cheese dressing with the hard boiled eggs and tomatoes and onions really made that steak salad and I miss it so much! I no longer order the new steak salad, because it tastes too healthy now...\nLast week, I tried a pork tenderloin dish with pomegranite sauce. It's another \"healthy\" menu option. It came with grilled asaragus and risotto. This was very good! It doesn't replace my blue cheese dressing steak salad favorite, but I will definitely order this again in the meantime until they hopefully bring my favorite salad back.", "business_id": "brz0ho_6H2RBhNzl97veEw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-04-27", "type": "review"}

So while I was in town for business last week I had to go. I have to admit, I was a bit underwhelmed. The food wasn't bad, it was actually good. But that's just it.... good. I certainly admire the moxy of the chef when creating his menu, but it's nothing I haven't seem back home. Asian inspired this and pickled that, I get it, I've seen it before and I like it.  But in this Asian, truffled, pickled world, if you're gonna do it, be better than everyone else. Bachi Burger isn't, but that's ok. As stated before, the food here is good. \n\nI started with the Oxtail Chili Fries. I love the addition of the sunny side up egg. I know, everything nowadays comes with a runny egg on top, but it really works here. The rich yolk plays well with the chili, that is a bit on the sweet side. The thinly sliced chiles add just the right amount of heat. The oxtail is nice and tender, perfectly cooked. The downside of the dish was the sweetness of the chili, but overall very good. \n\nI had the Pork Belly Steamed Buns based on several yelp reviews. I've made a similar dish at home and wanted to compare. These were nothing special, maybe a bit underseasoned, but again.... good. I really liked the dipping sauce, kind of a miso BBQ sauce. I'll stick to mine. \n\nThe service was excellent and friendly. \n\nWarning: My friend ordered his burger well done and the server told him it would take 25-30 minutes for his burger. I thought that was weird, but oh well. \n\nP.S. This is really a 2-1/2 Star review, and I will be back again to explore the menu a bit in hopes that I'll find that one \"wow\" item I'm looking for...\n\nUpdate to my review from a few months ago:\n\nRevisited Bachi Burger today for lunch. Had the Miyagi-San Burger and the Salt & Pepper French Fries. Both were epic!\n\nThe burger was perfectly cooked (medium rare) with bacon, furikake seasoning and onion rings. \n\nThe fries were possibly the best 'dressed up' fries I've ever had. Topped with onion salt, cilantro, fresh jalape\u00f1os, lemon grass (?) with a delicious dipping sauce. \n\nI'll be back for sure.", "business_id": "PXviRcHR1mqdH4vRc2LEAQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-03-23", "type": "review"}

We arrived to find that we were placed in the main dining area by the live band, despite our request to be seated in a quiet area.  However, the hostess was gracious about moving us to the other side of the place.  They have a good wine selection and the staff seems to know the wines fairly well.  I was surprised at the limited menu but figured better a few dishes  well prepared then lots of dishes done poorly.\nWe ordered bruschetta and the humus plate to start our evening.\nThe bruschetta is fabulous.  We had the apple. brie, fig jam w/agave drizzle and the tomato mozzarella.  Both were fabulous.  The humus was delish, a bit spicy (which i like) and there was plenty to go around.  \nBoth guys ordered the beef bourguignon, which the menu states is Julia Childs classic recipe, and accordingly is served over egg noodles.  The presentation was nice, but the beef was on the dry side.   I ordered the Strawberry salad which was very good.  Our 4th ordered the chicken w/pesto sauce and all she said was, next time I will order something else.   We all agreed that next time we would have the appetizers for dinner. \nThe service was excellent.  John was our server and he was attentive without being intrusive.

There are areas for pool, darts, and other fun games. They offer karaoke nights and team trivia nights.  They also have ample patio seating with both a smoking and nonsmoking sides.

Probably my favorite dish.  Most of their appetizers and salads are phenomenal. \n\nI am never disappointed by their drinks. The beer specials are always great tasting.

First of all, the Manhattan location doesn't accept reservations (calling their number is hilarious - basically a thank you for calling but go away message).  Secondly, I don't know any mobsters.  My chances of actually getting Regis Philbin to invite me is slim (though oddly enough, I think this is my only likely hope).  Lastly, I can't pony up enough $$ to actually buy myself a table there (one of 11 I think), that would be if one actually became free, which would never happen.  Then there are the logistics of eating at Rao's - since they are in the Hood, and you have to hire a car service to wait for you while you eat, or have someone drive your car and wait or something...   \n\nIn short, Las Vegas will have to be a flimsy, Disney-fied, substitute to experiencing the real thing.  The first question I had was, how could they open such a large restaurant, with so many tables and translate the experience from New York to Vegas?  The answer - Since no one has actually eaten at the original, it doesn't matter.\n\nThe decor is upscale pizza joint like, red and white checkered tableclothes and lots of photos of celebrities who apparently have made it in to Rao's.  I ordered the stuffed zucchini blossoms that were stuffed with cheese and anchovies and deep fried.  It was salty and gooey goodness.  At any Italian restaurant, I like to order either a bolognese or a red sauce type pasta, as I think it's a barometer to how good it is.  So, I had the rigatoni with red sauce and pancetta.  I have to say, it was very good, but not out of this world exceptional.  The meatballs didn't disappoint - moist and tasty.  \n\nThe service was very attentive - I think they imported some characters from New York to add charm.  It worked.  Overall, the atmosphere was an upscale but down home Italian American restaurant.  Here it seems like the recipes were handed down through generations, and there is lots of care taken to make solid dishes.  You won't find the food complicated by new fangled things like truffle oil and flavored foams.  I think it's exactly this which keeps Rao's in New York exclusive and packed every night with loyal diners, and they were successful in recreating (some of) the moment in Las Vegas.", "business_id": "_zrSQdISpB_qry9tb098rw", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-06-10", "type": "review"}

Saturday dinner was pretty busy, but service and quality stayed reliably at a high standard. \n\nService staff was very nice and prompt. They're usually very visible and attentive. They will refill your drinks quickly. A head waiter/manager type of person came around to check up on customers - which is always a good sign.\n\nThe food was pretty good, too. I'm not expecting the best cuts of lean meats here. The meat you pick was frozen as expected - and that is fine. It's stirfry, frozen is fine. I did wish the meat was sliced thinner by the supplier. But for what it was - it was good. Though they're missing out on an offering of lamb, they did have the other types of proteins usually included in a Mongolian grill. So the ingredient bar is good enough. They have 20 sauces ready for your choosing. I know what I liked in my stirfry, but they offer sauce recipes to help you out. \n\n* They actively try to keep the ingredient bar as clean as possible. During busy times it gets a little disarrayed - but it's not like cleaning staff are ignoring their duties. They clean and refill the food often.\n\nThe grill itself is run in as efficient manner as one can imagine when grilling an entire restaurant's meals. Be forewarned that when it gets busy you can have a line of 10 ppl waiting to put their raw ingredients in with the grill. Bring a friend to talk to or a phone! Though the food quality was pretty good at the end, one problem is that the cooking time is too long - usually to cook through the meat. Since they are not adding some sort of liquid (a salty broth would be nice) during the cooking process, the starches just start overcooking and a lot of it gets stuck on the grill. This affect is really visible when the grill is at full capacity and only 3-4 chefs are working. A positive is that they won't bother to give you the burned noodle parts. The chefs, though young like from college, were very polite and seemed to have a lot of fun grilling. So they're doing a pretty good job. \n\n* There's reviews mentioning that when chefs lose their spatulas to the floor, they'll re-use it. .... ???? That sounds preposterous. They are surrounded by 15 customers watching them cook their food. Anyways I actively checked every time a utensil fell to the floor to see where they ended up. The end up in the dirty dishes bin. \n\n* Spatulas ARE re-used for working between different customers' foods. I think that is fine. They scrape the spatulas between customers, at least. This does mean if you have any food allergies you need to make sure to mention it. AFAIK they have a system for this since the wait staff do ask if you have food allergies before you go up. \n\nThe food was yummy when I ate it.  \n\nThey have those 100 flavor soda machines so their drink selection is full of variety. Every time I asked to change flavors the waiter was prompt to get it.\n\nIs $13 for this dinner buffet a smart choice? Yes. I cook sometimes and I eat out sometimes. Cooking up a stirfry is going to be cheaper, but sometimes you're lazy. If you're lazy, you're going to eat out. I've tried so many places in West Madison. You're putting in at least $10 anywhere else just for an entree. I think HuHot is the best value for my money if I'm looking for a good sitr-fry and I'm ready to eat to my heart's content. All the staff so far have been very polite - and it was a great experience to come out having my stir-fry cravings fulfilled.\n\nI hope their service continues at the level I've experienced.\n\nFun stuff: A great sauce mix: Soy sauce, garlic, chili garlic sauce, chili oil.  \nSimple but delicious in your mouth.", "business_id": "r9qTBqmKG4TCb4IE6NcVXQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-12-09", "type": "review"}

When we were sat, our server asked if we wanted water, we said yes, as we assumed that like every other restaurant, the water is free..but that was not the case.  We were not told they had imported water (until we asked about it when we got the bill), who needs imported water? During the meal, they kept filling our water glasses, with no mention of a charge or if we wanted to have more of their special water. We were made aware of this when we recieved our bill with $36 charge for water.\n\nWe also purchased cocktails,  and the water costed us more then the cocktails. Just be aware of this when you visit this establishment. \n\nNow to the food. I was not impressed, and my wife (a huge Gordan Ramsay fan) was disappointed.  We ordered the Beef Wellington for two, and it was not seasoned well at all. It was bland, although cooked perfectly. \n\nI do not want to be all negative.  The bread plate was amazing, and our appetizers were wonderful. To end our meal, I tried the Sticky Pudding that everyone was raving about,  and I was blown away. \n\nIf it was not for the water situation,  and the bland wellingtons, it might have seemed like a $300 meal, but unfortunately the quality and service did not meet our expectations.  With so many options in Vegas, I would hesitate to spend my hard earned money here again. \n\nSo to end...the food was just ok...desert was amazing, service was slow, environment was loud, and watch out for the expensive water. \n\nMaybe they can train their staff to clarify that they have imported water, because it was told to us...until we got the bill.", "business_id": "mDdqifuTrfXAOfxiLMGu5Q", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-11-29", "type": "review"}

The potatoes were really good though, they weren't all greasy and diner tasting, they were as healthy as potatoes can get maybe? The farmer's market was awesome though, not greasy, really light, lots of flavor, and a pretty presentation.

Realistically I love going to LGO, because it's always a lovely time with my friends.  BUT I think Ncounter offered an awesome brunch with my friends, and the food was better.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNcounter will definitely be a new regs place for us... in fact I'll be back today? The salads that went by looked amazing.    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast thing that needs to be said....GET THE PUMPKIN COOKIE.  Holy fricken mother, I think we all died and went to heaven eating that cookie.  I am not even kidding... if those were around me everyday...easily the fast track to morbid obesity.  This being said, you should defs give Ncounter a try.", "business_id": "GRFunGSUZxXqNCZJrN8Oow", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-10-12", "type": "review"}

Service, food, ambiance, decor.. everything is SPOT on! Came here for a late night dinner with my 3 girlfriends. We were in Vegas for 5 days and decided this would be our extravagant night to eat out. This place does not disappoint! As soon as we walk in I see Guy Fieri (Food Network Star) and found out that Kid Rock had just left (he had a concert in the Cosmopolitan that night). You just never know who you'll see here! Being taken to their \"fish market\" and actually picking the fish you will be dining on was a very very very cool experience. The food is amazing.. you just can't go wrong with anything you pick. I'm bad with fish names but just know that you will get THE finest quality and they make sure the flavor is great. It's family style with the side portions so we had a greek salad, grilled octopus (MMMM.. good) and hand cut fries. Dessert was baklava and my oh my it was good!

Not only are they perfectly cooked and seasoned, but they provide the largest portion of escargot I've come across in Vegas. With that for a starter, I'm sold. I went with the grill plate - a mountain of meats with seasoned rice. While I wasn't a fan of the meatballs, every other item on the platter was delicious.

The steak was one of the most delicious I've had in quite some time.  To my utter sadness, there was no refrigerator in our room, so I could not take my leftovers back.  Even now I feel sad I could not revisit this delicious NY bone-in aged steak, cooked medium rare to perfection, seasoned so well no additonal salt, pepper or sauces were needed.  I wish I could have taken it back and loved it some more.  But, I digress!  The sides were great - we ordered the asparagus, mashed potatoes, and mac and cheese.  I didn't try the mashed potatoes, as often that is not my favorite, but the mac and cheese so so good and rich, heavy, homemade noodles in a rich and very cheesy cream sauce- YUM!  The asparagus was also great.  Gallagher's does a good job and keeping a dimmed, steakhouse ambiance, even though it's smack dab in the middle of the NY NY casino, which is loud and over the top, to say the least.  It was nice to come here dressed up.  True, it's not as ambient as some steak houses outside of Vegas, such as Morton's in LA, but you are in Vegas, so you have to give Gallagher's kudos to keeping that ambience alive inside its walls.  The Oregon Pinot Noir I had here was good, nothing wowing - I was hoping for some CA Pinot on the menu.  DH's soup was very good.  My caesar salad was pretty bland, dressed very lightly.  It was just okay.  But, the steak- wow.  The dessert menu looked amazing, but we were just too full.", "business_id": "Ensu96ecI0OReupNS2x7ig", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-04-04", "type": "review"}

I would go to one star if it was based on service and the other items they serve alone. The salad bar has a good selection of toppings and dressings. But they should get rid of the premium toppings. The items you get for another $2.50 and are just not worth it. I also do not see why we have to pay extra for drinks. With the cost of a beverage added it brings the cost above that of other buffets in town. Other pretty good buffets. If it weren't for the salad and soups I would not go at all. The soup is always pretty good and I just love the chili. It does not seem to be consistent, but always good.\n\nThis last visit the line we ware in was just stopped. We stood in line for over ten minutes while the other line was processed and seated. People that came in long after my wife and I were seated well before we were. It seems there was a large party at the front of our line and they had them stand there waiting to be seated. When we got to the front of the line we asked to talk to a manager and the lady behind the counter said she was one and how could she help. We explained what had happened and she said she could not do anything about it and we needed to speak to the people doing the seating. Excuse me! A manager has no control over how the staff is working? That does not seem right. Once we were seated we did talk to someone who was a manager and she was very thoughtful. She even gave us coupons for a free visit.\n\nAnother thing I do not understand is there fresh fruit bar. It consisted of whole apples, grapes and oranges.

They were on Dirty Dining and they were on one of those Mystery Diner shows as well. Both of these PR situations went very poor for them. On top of that the owner was one of he main people who struck out against food trucks in Vegas. All of this equals bad PR. Add to the fact I have had one friend who had an absolutely horrendous time here and another friend who has experienced really mediocre visits. So why did I even go back?\n\nI bought a coupon off of restaurant.com. That's why. I went for lunch on a very non-busy Tuesday afternoon (about 2 PM). I walked in to a completely empty dining room, a completely empty patio, and one waitress. I was seated in the main dining area.\n\nSupposedly they have gone through some changes, new wait staff, and new head chef. I really did not see any changes to the menu though. What I ordered:\n\nBishop's Peak Chardonnay ($9.95) recommended by the server. It was decent. It had a buttery texture, although a bit too acidic at the end for me to shell out another 10 bucks for a second glass.\n\nFrench Onion Soup ($7) - The broth did not have enough depth. The onions used were chopped a bit too small for my liking and the were clumped heavily together in the bottom of the bowl. However, it was not charred on top and the cheeses used complimented the soup very well. They made a unique flavor to the soup that I cannot deny I enjoyed.\n\nChicken Club ($11) - It comes with a choice of fries, or salad, I picked the fries and honestly these fries were superb. Not greasy. Crispy, yet not over-done. There was a hint of spiciness to them that I quite enjoyed. As for the sandwich it is quite large, so I took one half home. There was a lot of bread, too much honestly. Avocados, which I love and the veggies on it were fresh enough. The chicken could have been just a bit more moist, but I will not complain.\n\nOverall, I was pleased, that is until I handed over my restaurant.com certificate and my debit card for payment. The server returned with my bill with added gratuity, and already charged to my card. This is the second time I've been bamboozled in such a way by a restaurant after they see my gift certificate. I was not a large party, I was one person. So why was I charged an automatic gratuity? Nothing on restaurant.com's certificates say you will be charged. It simply says to tip on the amount of the REAL check, not the discount. So apparently this waitress saw fit to go ahead and just charge me her tip without me asking.\n\nI would have paid 20%, that's 2% more than what most people pay. And I always pay 20% because I used to be a server. I understand there are some cheap-o's out there, but when you assume everyone is going to stiff you, you are really opening yourself up for some criticism. Had the waitress not put her sly moves on my debit card I would have gladly given more stars as I really did enjoy my meal.", "business_id": "LuYZUc1MOG0pA146SCeXgA", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-10-01", "type": "review"}

They gave me a choice of $125 or $175. I figured go big or go home so I got the more expensive. All of the cold courses were amazing. Just what you would expect. The standouts were the 1st course octopus and 2nd tuna tartar. After that were sashimi and sushi which included no salmon (they asked what I liked in the beginning and I said salmon) and I was suprised they didn't give me any. Then came the prepared food. Scallop really good. Wagu beef melt in your mouth but very fatty and greasy. Would not get again and the beef was why I paid the $50 more. There was a cold noodle dish as last course before dessert that was boring and forgettable. Dessert was good. I had to order sashimi salmon and pay separately which was $ and unfair in my opinion seeing as I was sitting at sushi bar and voiced that I liked salmon. If I did it again I would get the $125 menu and skip the wagu and be more vocal that I wanted salmon when they brought my sushi/sashimi course. Overall, amazing sushi.

We decided to sit inside but there is an outdoor option. I was there for the wine so I asked her for something different that I can't just get anywhere. She was very accommodating and brought me 4 ounces of Cotes Catalanes, Riberach n\u00famero 8 (10 dollars). I thoroughly enjoyed it. The girls wanted cocktails so she also made something called \"j'aime la vie\". I tasted the fun purple drink that came and it was quite tasty.\n\nWe ordered 7 plates for the table and shared everything. Makes it a bit hard for pairing with wine so we got a bottle for the table and ordered 4oz each of the pairing that went with the agnolotti described below. For 50 bucks she suggested a bottle called Langue La Ferma. Great recommendation. The wine pairing that went with the agnolotti described below was an orange wine (what?!?!) called \"Que Pasa\" from France, domaine leonine which was 13 bucks for the 4oz. Very enjoyable, especially to my friend who tends to prefer white over red. \n\nNow for the 7 plates we ordered! All incredible...nicely plated and so delicious.\n\nMushrooms flaky pastry salsify pur\u00e9e, cipollini onions, crispy Parmesan. The favourite at 18 bucks.\n\nAgnolotti stuffed with guinea fowl confit, green olives, gre des champs cheese, gunpowder mixed spices for 15 bucks. We ordered two since it only comes with 4 agnolottis.\n\nCornish hen, flageolet beans, fried sage, sauce perfumed with juniper berries. 18 bucks.\n\nTrout declination. (Three ways). Caraway rillette, gravlax, unilateral cooked, confit garlic yogurt. 17 bucks.\n\nTo get our veggies in we ordered the Asparagus 2 ways for 15 bucks and had the most delicious quail eggs.\n\nDuck tartar, black fig, foie gras in a cloth. Cabernet Sauvignon vinegar reduction for 15 bucks. \n\nI loved that they split the bill into 4.

But there's just no excuse for bad service in a high-end, expensive Vegas restaurant like this. Not when there are so many other amazing restaurants to enjoy.\n\nThe first time I came here, we were promptly seated at the sushi bar, where we just sat... forever... with nothing.. no drinks, no water, no menu. We looked uncomfortably around wondering if the restaurant was really even open yet. I finally had to awkwardly ask the sushi chef if we were supposed to order drinks from him (which is normally bad etiquette in a sushi restaurant, as the chefs only make the sushi). Finally a waitress showed up with menus and took our drink orders. And at some point later in the evening, those drinks finally found their way to us.\n\nIn sharp contrast to the incompetent waitress, the sushi chefs were AMAZING. We ordered several of the high-end specialty sushi rolls (at about $26 a roll), and what we received was as delicious as it was beautiful. My favorites were the Titan roll, which was like a piece of art, and the Katana roll. Everything was so fresh and tasty.\n\nMeanwhile, we finished our drinks and ordered a second round. Once again we waited.. and waited... and waited. Keep in mind, there wasn't ANYONE else in our section... the restaurant was not busy at all, the bartenders at the bar looked bored... yet we waited and waited and waited some more for our drinks. By now, we had already finished the meal, and honestly, probably even digested it already. Once again I had to awkwardly ask the sushi chef for help. Only this time I asked for a manager (after explaining to the chef that he had done nothing wrong!).  The manager apologized, and soon we had our drinks. But really, we didn't even care at that point because we were ready to leave. Then I was shocked when I first received the bill, as nothing had been comped, but later when the slip came for me to sign, I found that he had comped the drinks and some of the sushi, so at least there's that.\n\nIn our most recent trip to Vegas, we decided to give this restaurant another shot, since we liked the sushi so much. This time we sat at a table with a great view of the strip. I really liked the decor of the dining room, and felt quite comfortable there. But once again, the service disappointed us.  The first item we tried to order was the Oyster sushi, and were told they were out.  Next we tried to order the Spanish Mackerel sushi, and were told they were out of that too. Finally we ordered some rolls that they did have... and the waiting began again. As more and more time passed and we still hadn't received our sushi, I realized that this restaurant just has fundamental service problems. The waiter apologized and explained that sushi chefs were \"slammed,\" but really, there's just no excuse for that when you are paying $26 a roll. We had tickets to see a show later, and I was starting to stress about whether we were even going to make it on time. I was also annoyed when the waiter gave us only a little bit of wasabi and ginger, to share, and then he even took that away partway through the meal!  I had to ask for more.\n\nI think this restaurant has so much potential, and I really do think the sushi here is very good. But bad service just ruined the whole experience for me. If it weren't for the great sushi and wonderful view of Vegas, I'd definitely be giving this restaurant only one star. Later in this same trip, we ate at Blossom in the Aria hotel, paid $20-$25 per entree, and had some of the most amazing service we've had in a restaurant. When you are in Vegas, you want to have fun and be treated like a king... and Sushi Roku just didn't do it for me.

One guy comes over and said oh its because we use a powder!  So we refused the drink!\n\nWe ordered (2) #19 which was like pho tai w/ flanks.  One came out and I was still waiting for mine, so finally we got someone's attention and told him we're still missing another one of this (pointing at the first #19 we got).  They guy was like whats that, so I said #19, OMG-- they go and open the menu to see what it is and then goes to take the one that we have away.  We were like NO what are you doing!  We ordered 2 of this, leave this one and bring another.  \n\nI swear there are a bunch of morons working in this place!!!!  STRONGLY ADVISE PEOPLE TO STAY AWAY!!!   The food is not even good!!!!  Worst Pho EVER!!!!!  Paying at the cashier you can feel how sticky the floor was!!!", "business_id": "gCo--CY5aUoByxUAET2cTw", "stars": 1, "date": "2008-09-02", "type": "review"}

There food is delicious and a fairly diverse menu. But what really impressed me, outside of the drink, was the service. All of the service staff was attentive and friendly. I wasn't stuck with my server, everyone made an effort to check up on the table. Whenever we needed something, it was addressed right away.

The shorty stack of onion rings had six batter dipped onion rings that were very tasty. My wife had the wings as her main course.

Those employees that have remained all these years are genuinely friendly & professional!!  For years, Susan was our favorite server... she is now the Manager!  David has become our new favorite server!!  But ALL the servers are great, the hostesses are super nice & helpful, and the busboys are prompt & friendly & willing to help out with whatever as well!\nQuality of food is totally awesome about 98% of the time... once in a while the bread is a little undercooked... gummy & doughy inside... and about 1 in 25 times the pizza is a little bit burnt, but not bad enough to make it inedible!  Only once did we ever get a pizza that we couldn't eat, and they offered to remake it immediately!  Overall, the flavors are delicious!!  Two of us get one small pizza and between the free bread and the great filling pizza, it's more than enough for us... and that makes a very reasonably priced dinner for two!\n\nThey also make GREAT cannoli as well!  Tastes awesome & I believe they make them themselves!\n\nEvery time friends or family come to town, we always take them to Metro at least once, and every dish anyone has ever tried has been great!  They always thank us for taking them there and ask to go back the next time they come to town!\n\nMetro Pizza is by far my favorite pizza restaurant in Las Vegas!!

Tuna salad, with  melt-in-your-mouth croutons and an array of homemade dressings to choose from?  Pure yumminess.  My husband also adores the club sandwich.  Oh, and the muffins.  Delectable!\n\nAs creatures of habit, my order is always the same: Veggie burger, with cheese, side of soup and fruit.

It was warm, nit hot but tasted like glue. The hush puppy's were good, though.\nNow, the brisket... I'm not from Texas and love me some pork BBQ  (Lexington is the gold standard) but this brisket was weak... The \"fall off the bone\" tender actually was mushy. It tasted like it was boiled or steamed before it hit the smoker. It had NO smoke ring and the smoke flavor seemed to be artificial. I ordered mixed fatty and lean, as I know fatty is the way to go. It was actually greasy, not the luscious melted fat of a well smoked brisket. The \"bark\" was soggy and was overly salty. Again I think it had liquid smoke or smoked salt. or something. No spice or depth of flavor. Again the meat was \"unnaturally\" tender. steamed or boiled or maybe a \"meat tenderizer\" was added. A bright pink smoke ring should show on a brisket this thick, but none was apparent.\n\nNeedless to say, I was disappointed, especially at $10 for a small plate (1 side).\n\nI'll give them another shot, but anyone how gives this place 3 stars or better doesn't know what they are talking about when it comes to Q!

To me, biscuits are too doughy, dry out your mouth and are hard to swallow (that's what she said, lol).  But the biscuit was phenomenal!  It was baked perfectly, doughy but lite enough to swallow.  I can't comment on the apple butter - didn't try it; didn't need to.  The Biscuit was perfect with a little butter and jam.  \n\nMy overall food experience here was AMAZING!  Everything was prefect.  I cannot shower the food with enough praises!  Everything tasted freshly cooked and prepared.  Everyone I was with also enjoyed their respective meals.  My friend got the Southern Scramble, which I sampled and can also offer my stamp of approval for.  \n\nService:  Service was excellent.  Waitress was very polite & friendly but not intrusive.   She refilled our waters two or three times (hey, it was hot outside remember).  Food was not exactly lightening fast in arriving, but sometimes you don't mind waiting if you know the food is being freshly prepared.    \n\nPrice:  VERY AFFORDABLE for the amount of food that you get.

Ok so we walked in and weren't offered a table, for some reason the host asked if we would sit at the bar. We both thought that was because there were no seats so we said ok.

Waitress finally came over and we split the meatball platter which has 1 of each meatball and each sauce, perfect for 2 people on our first time here. Well the meatballs were not good... They were all dry, I dunked them in sauce just to choke them down. The flavor wasn't even there. And when it came to the Veggie meatball I almost gagged. It tasted nothing like a veggie burger, it was mushy and just inedible. I wanted so badly to spit it out, but I swallowed it with a huge gulp of water and even shoved extra sauce in my mouth. Gross! Even the sauces were lacking. The marinara was okay?! Nothing special though. We also shared a piece of pizza... Nothing impressive, and it was kinda burnt from being reheated. Not to mention our food came out about 5 minutes after ordering so I'm betting it was all premade and probably microwaved based on the dryness. I wouldn't ever return....

Normally my choices are, from what he says, not good; but Streetcar Po' Boys was a great one!\n\nIf you are coming from the Westside,  Summerlin,  Spring Valley, or any location West of the 15 my suggestion would be to take any side street, Rainbow, Decatur, Jones, Durango, or what have you and go straight down Oakey. GPS is lame and takes you all these crazy routes. Basically,  its next to Little Darlings off Western and Oakey right under the 15.\n\nUpon entering we were greeted by the hostess and D'nis let us choose where we wanted to sit. We chose a spot next to the kitchen and it was a great choice because we got to speak to the cook and workers throughout our visit.  We checked out the menu and being that I'm a lame and don't eat any seafood besides shrimp I opted for The Big Easy (9.25$) my friend was going with the same alas their shipment of goodies was delayed so I got the last remaining shrimp, yay me, sorry breh! He is more adventurous and got The Gulf (8.95$) fully dressed. With your Po' Boy you get cajun chips, and coleslaw.  You can opt to add sides which start at 1.99 $ more. He also ordered a Cafe Au Late which I had a sip of and it was sweet and delicious! \n\nWhilst waiting for our food we chatted with the cook, who was extremely informative and super nice! He told us how all of their seafood and bread is flown in from Louisiana, and that granny wouldn't have it any other way, awesome! We ordered beignets (3 for 3.50 $) and they were brought out to us hot and fresh! They were delectable,  but beware of that pesky powdered sugar! These are definitely a great accompaniment to the cafe!\n\nOur Po' boys were brought out and we were super impressed.  I ordered mine sans tomatoes, and it was perfect!  The shrimp was not overcooked or overly/underly breaded and the mayo they use is a great compliment to the bread and all the fixins. The catfish used in my friends sandwich is different from their normal strips, granny opted for large filets which were flaky and delicious my friend said. The cajun chips are also delicious with a zing added with those yummy Creole spices! Coleslaw was also yummy, not too acidic like some other places. \n\nDuring our grubfest the cook came out to assure we were satisfied and also offered us samples of either fried or grilled alligator. I didn't wimp out and actually tried a piece of the fried, which was not bad. A sweet little cooks helper came out and offered us some banana bread muffins she was experimenting with and wanted our honest opinions on them, they were sensational but I suggested possibly adding walnuts to half the batch as D'nis is not kosher with them dudes. \n\nAll in all this was an excellent choice on my behalf, haha. The food is tasty and customer service is just amazing! The food is reason to go back, but customer service is what's going to get you to stay and be regulars.  \n\nWe will definitely be back!

I used to work in this shopping center so I ended up at it a shameful amount. They have always, always been a hot mess. \n\nStill, I always seem to forget and give it another chance, but I had the worst fast food experience of my life here a few weeks ago. \n\nIt was about 11:30 p.m. when I pulled into the drive-thru, with 4 cars ahead of me. I place my order and pull up a little bit. That was the last time I moved for the next 20 minutes. It is not an exaggeration. The drive-thru is set up so that there is absolutely no way you can get out of it once you're in it. I was trapped in this stupid drive-thru for what felt like an eternity, and I hadn't even paid.\n\nWhen I finally get to the first window, there is nobody there. After about a minute the girl came scurrying in and had to ask me what I had ordered. Holy. Crap. (As a side note, cashier girl, if you ever read this, I'm sorry I was kind of rude to you. I felt pretty bad about it. It wasn't your fault.)\n\nAnyway, after finally paying, we're stuck again. While I'm waiting, I can see the food window handing bags and taking them back from the car that's there currently. Great, they're messing up orders. The next car has the same situation.\n\nI get up to the window and the guy hands me a bag that is very clearly not my food based on the size, but I checked anyway. Nope. I wait for him to come back and tell him, and he grabs the other bag that had been sitting there since before I even got to the window and hands me that one instead. No apology, nothing. He didn't even look inside either of the bags.\n\nThe worst part of all of it is that after this 30-minute journey, my fries were so cold. So, so cold. Hot McDonald's fries are the only reason to go to McDonald's! At that point, I just wanted to get as far away as possible from this place. \n\nIt should never be so hard to get terrible food.

Second was the required valet parking. I don't care if it's \"free\" (let's be real, you still need to tip the guys), but showing up at a tap house, you're not exactly expecting to hand your car over to someone.\n\nWhen we got upstairs, they had a clearly marked sign that said SEAT YOURSELF, so we thought, \"okay,\" and started wandering around for a place to sit, squeezing ourselves all the way to the back and then circling around. No seats. Got back up to the front and asked one of the servers, who looked at us like we were stupid and said, \"you need to be put on the list.\" Okay. Take down your sign guys, why would you have that posted? So we sat in a small section off to the side waiting and proceeded to watch several other groups come in and do the same thing we did. Unfortunately, we couldn't warn them without jumping up and catching them as it is incredibly noisy on the inside and they wouldn't have heard us from where we were.\n\nFood was alright, but not remarkable. Certainly not worth the hassle. And the beer was good, but it's not exactly hard to come across good craft beer in the valley these days.\n\nIt would have to be someone's birthday, or they'd have to have some damn, good special tapping for me to go back.", "business_id": "pVnUE5EeIaIbjXzaH7sLyw", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-03-31", "type": "review"}

I seriously don't even want to like them sometimes, or so it seems -- my Sicilian grandma can probably kick your favorite chef's butt when it comes to rich Southern Italian fare.  Add to this the fact that I'm still grieving the loss of my old standby, Pappa Razzini's, where I was quite practically a part of the family, but I digress.\n\nI had been eagerly looking forward to trying La Cucina Italiana, as it just recently opened not too far from my house in Laveen -- and seriously, the 75,000 or so people located between downtown and South Mountain deserve more dining options than what we have had in the past.  Quiessence and Amano's were our two best options before this restaurant opened, and it now joins those on my list of local favorites.\n\nLast night, my neighbor conveniently derailed what was supposed to be a guys' night out by instead turning it into a double date night.  That's cool.  Babysitter, check.  Inexpensive entrees and free BYOB wine policy, check.  Wait, what?!  Yep, we brought along a couple bottles of our own wine and paid nothing in corking fees.  Apparently, they plan to start charging as soon as the restaurant gets its liquor license in a couple weeks, but Chef Andy says he plans to keep it limited to $5.  And he has plans for an awesome rooftop cigar bar, which will have amazing views of the mountain.  I'm very much looking forward to all of this.\n\nSo here's my take on where the restaurant stands now on food, service, and ambience:\n\nAs we walked in, I definitely got a \"new restaurant\" vibe -- not in a bad way, mind you, but it wasn't quite chugging along yet.  I also picked up on the fact that the decor spoke to something a little nicer than the typical $10 entrees on the menu.  But I think this is perfect for the area, which can support both the higher end unique fine dining experience and a locally owned affordable kind of restaurant.  This place is like the perfect compromise.\n\nSo here we are in a new restaurant, a first visit for our entire group.  A member of the waitstaff greeted us immediately and seated us at a table for four, plopping the stack of menus in the middle of the table and walking away -- apparently a different server would be taking care of us.  Next, we were handed a tasty looking antipasto platter by a younger guy who endeavored to tell us what was on it, but we proceeded to finish all his sentences for him.  Then the server brought out our water, wine glasses, and a cork screw.  We got the wine flowing as we looked over the menu, which had a pasta selection divided by pasta types -- all were long noodles, except for the gnocchi.  When my wife asked if she could interchange sauces and pastas, the server went to the kitchen to check before coming back and saying yes.\n\nSo on to our salads and entrees.  Our table shared both the caprese salad and one like it but with gorgonzola and onions, which I thought was a great alternative to the all too common caprese.  My wife ordered gnocchi with pesto and I had the fettuccine with eggplant in a cream sauce.  Both dishes were perfectly executed, and we got to learn precisely why....\n\nChef Andy is definitely a first-class chef and restauranteur.  When one of the members of our party noticed a problem with her plate, he personally came out to apologize and offer to bring her a part of her entree so that she could start eating with everyone else as he fixed everything.  This was a great way to handle the problem, as it was the beginning of our friendship with Chef Andy.  He came back out to check on us after the meal, when we noticed that there were no more new arrivals coming in, so we invited Andy to join us for a drink and chat for a while.\n\nA few things we learned:\n\n1.  A high-butterfat cream means richer cream sauces without having to add extra butter or oil.\n2.  A decent cook should be able to saut\u00e9 in any pan.  Sure it's sometimes nice to have a coated non-stick pan for eggs, but everything else will do fine in almost any stainless pan.\n3.  Chef Andy is something of an Italian purist.  He even plans to start his wine list with only Italian labels.  This is just fine by me, although I also urged him to try a couple of the Italian style AZ varieties.  Next time, I guess I'll just have to bring a bottle.\n\nSo why only 4 stars?  A few reasons:\n-Several hiccups in the service that need to be addressed, and should be easily overcome with a little extra training, experience, and confidence.\n-Ambience was hampered a tad by the glaring Circle K lights from next door, but this too is being addressed with some forthcoming window shades.\n-Pasta menu was a little confusing.  I personally don't usually care about the difference between different pasta shapes.  If the chef does care about this, then please at least tell me why.  Otherwise, I'd prefer to see the menu organized by different criteria, like sauce types.\n\nI look forward to revisiting this restaurant soon.", "business_id": "lBxBzvqWaiO4pa3YHh2dyQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-09-05", "type": "review"}

I've visited the NYC location so had a sense of what to expect.  Great steak, great wine list, hopefully great service, with a little ambience thrown in for good measure.\n\nBright and modern with a slightly funky vibe, the restaurant is pretty to look at while sipping a wonderfully made martini in the bar before dinner.  (I might stop mentioning martinis in my reviews because they're starting to add up...lol.)  Nonetheless, you can't go wrong here.  My beloved lemon drop was just tart enough to start the evening off nicely.\n\nI dined with someone who's probably a learned oenophile and he seemed pleased with the wine choices.  In fact, the sommelier came over after he made a selection from the Paso Robles region and suggested another wine from the same region available via BLT's private stock. While I may not have been able to tell much difference between selection 1 and selection 2, this red blend was divine.  (Oh dear - we're still discussing alcohol...onward Yelpers!)\n\nAnd so, to the meal.  Surprisingly, no wedge with blue cheese, which I love prior to eating steak but the Caesar was good.  Crisp, cold romaine with very fresh Parmesan cheese and housemade croutons.  Lovely.\n\nMe - Bone-in ribeye.  Him - New York strip.  Us - Grilled asparagus.  Assessment - awesome!  Both steaks were fresh, prepared to perfection and served in the finishing skillet (I presume).  The marbling in the ribeye was perfect with the bone-in choice providing even more flavor.  There is simply no way any normal human can consume an entire steak at this place.  Quite generous portioning being the reason.\n\nNo dessert for us as we preferred to continue sipping from that great bottle of wine. \n\nFour stars only and I was torn here. Our service was adequate overall (though the sommelier was quite the nice guy), with our server being efficient but not very personable.  Hey - I like a smile with my meal, a little light banter perhaps.  Make the diners feel welcome.  So, taking a star off for that reason alone.

I received a mailer in the mail promoting a free sandwich. This week highlighted the grilled chicken whic is perfect because I don't eat red meat.\n\nThe Resturant is a cute modern style establishment. Hip music playing when you walk into the small dining area that includes outside patio service. The establishment is very clean and organized.\n\nI came during lunch hour so it was busy. Limited parking and a long line that went fast. I decided to take my order to go. I have say I was not greeted when I walked in which could because the Resturant was slammed. There is a trendy virtual menu to look at while waiting in line. The cashier noticed my coupon and said \"there are many steps to this sandwich order.\" Then she asked me questions on what I did and did not want. It was confusing because I did not see these options on the virtual menu like Smashburger. I also felt rushed. See at Smashburger they always ask you if this is your first time dining at the Resturant. Then they welcome you or they thank you for returning. I added onion rings to my order and that was it. \n\nThe wait time was not long. They give buzzers to their guest so you know when your food is prepared. I feel it takes that personal touch away. At Smashburger your assigned a number then your food is delivered to you. This is for dine in. Takeout they walk the food over to you. I checked my order to make sure my food was accurate. My sandwich was prepared wrong. I asked for no cheese and they put it on there by accident. My sandwhich was quickly remade as the grilled chicken is already prepared. They just pull it out of a silver heated container and reheat the meat. There was never an apology. I was just ignored and told to wait.\n\nI got home to indulge and noticed I was not given any napkins or condiments. My food was nicely wrapped which helped it stay warm. My chicken sandwhich had a nice presentation garnished with lettuce and an orange slice. My sandwich bread was soaked in butter. I like the type of bread but way to much butter. The chicken and veggies were good. My onion rings were good as well. They were not salty or to greasy. I have to say it was not bad but I am all about customer service and a great experience. I may try them again but I am not in a hurry. Smashburger has sold me since the very first time I walked through there doors. I have been to three in the valley and have had the same great experience at each location.

Our food(and all other people's)sat for a good five minutes or more before she served it to us ( by the way I am not blaming her ..she was too busy and they were grossly under staffed)\n\nTo boot it was 103 degrees and the air conditioner was not working, so she was spending lots of time(unsuccessfully) trying to get it up and running, we were sitting by the thermostat and it read 82 and climbing by the minute.\n\nFor Vegans the menu has the option to sub the real cheese out for soy cheese or Daiya cheese.\n\nI chose the soy cheese, while my wife took the Daiya since she loves that stuff, (me i find it a bit tangy normally) so i figured i would try this soy cheese option. \n\nMy pizza was very good, i am a big pizza sauce fan, and in my opinion can make or break a pizza-this had good sauce, perhaps too much for the average person, but i usually ask for extra anyways so that was fine for me, the crust was great(they do have a multi grain crust as well which i did no try)and i did eat my whole pizza so that is a good sign there.\n\nThey also have as a topping , a gardein chicken which is unheard of  to find at a pizza place, but it gives vegans an option besides just mushroom, black olive,and the other staples we are usually stuck with. I did try the gardein chicken, but probably would not the next time as its a bit too close to the real thing for my liking, and when i was not vegan i never did like chicken on my pizza in the first place.\n\nIn conclusion the pizza was good, but I do not think I would drive a half hour to get it weekly, however, if you live in the area you may want to check it out for sure\n\nFor desert  one of the options was a vegan home made brownie which was quite  good also, it was two triangle brownies for 4.00 which i thought was a good buy.\nThey also have some orangic sodas, ice teas, which i did not try personally.\n\nFor you non vegans, this review was biased mainly towards vegans so i apologize but i am sure you will like it just fine.", "business_id": "EFCvuMgTXsLnd7eGkKsivA", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-05-22", "type": "review"}

After wandering around like a tourist for a bit, I walked upstairs to BlackFinn.  It was around 4:30, so I was sent to the bar downstairs, as the upstairs wasn't open yet?  Whatever... we found a spot easily at the big bar downstairs and were served by a friendly bartender who kept us drowning in drinks for 2 hours (great job!).\n\nFor apps, we sampled the pretzels served with cheese sauce and the queso (more cheese) dip with tortilla chips.  The soft and warm pretzels, instead of being coated in coarse salt, were lightly sprinkled with what I think was parm cheese - good job - very good, much better than me flicking salt off all over the bar area.  The cheese dip was creamy and had a mustardy undertone to it.  The chipotle queso and chips were also very good.
