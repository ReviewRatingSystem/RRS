The selection is wide, the food is delicious, and the price is nice (but much better during the half off periods.)\n\nThe service is pretty mediocre at best, but to be honest I didn't expect much.  They're slow, generally unfriendly, and my water goes unfilled a lot. It wasn't always that way, but oh well.  The atmosphere is pretty enjoyable, in my opinion.  I like having late night food and drinks while Bollywood music videos blare in the background.  It makes for a loud restaurant, but when you're partying late at night, you're not looking for a quiet place.\n\nOverall, this is a good place for Indian food.  The selection is great, with tons of things on the menu (almost 100 or more I think).  It's definitely not the best Indian food in the Burgh, but the portions and prices let you share a bunch of dishes around, resulting in what I'd consider a true Indian dining experience.  I'd recommend late night after 10, when the food goes half-price.", "business_id": "c4AWh6H_hI6FkiWAmdrQvQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-04-25", "type": "review"}

With high hopes being that they have several other locations nationwide as well as being a part of The One group, this was what I could only describe as a series of unfortunate events.  I do understand that this was a pre-opening event and the team was still trying to work out the kinks but some of these issues that arose could have been avoided.\n\nMy friend and I arrived for our reservation about 45 mins early being that she was able to get out of work and over to Bagatelle sooner than expected.  We checked in at the hostess stand being aware that we might not get seated until the time of our reservation.  The hostess did inform us they would try to seat us as soon as a table was available.  We waited at the bar area as instructed and were give quite a few drink tickets which we greatly appreciated.  After waiting past the time of our original reservation, watching 5 other parties get sat, many empty tables in the restaurant and asking one of the hostess' to check on our reservation, we finally decided to walk over to the hostess stand ourselves.  We were then told that the reservation didn't exist even though they had found the reservation almost an hour prior and had supposedly checked us in.  A small argument ensued amongst the hostess' and the content being each blaming the other for accidently cancelling our reservation instead of actually checking us in the first time around.  Our reservation had to be re-entered and they were able to seat us about 5 more mins after that.\n\nAfter we were sat, the server for our section was assisting the table directly next to us.  Once he was done with that table, he walked away without even acknowledging that we were there.  It took about 10 mins before he finally returned giving us menus to look over and asked us what beverages we would like.  It took about another 8 mins before someone came and poured water in our glasses.  It took about another 5-10 mins before we were given bread for the table and for our server to go over the menu with us.  We were told that for the invite, we would be able to share an appetizer, order an entr\u00e9e each and then dessert as well.  \n\nBecause we had already looked over the menu when we were at the bar, we decided on the foie gras appetizer, I the rack of lamb and my friend the filet.  We also ordered the potatoes puree and asparagus as sides.  The food was very good however it seemed that they could work on the timing of the courses a little for future services.  It didn't take long for the appetizer to come out but we had long finished the appetizer and the plate cleared before our entrees were served.  There seemed to be at least a 15 min gap between the appetizer plate being cleared before we were given the next course.  I do not know if the kitchen was backed up being that they were probably still in the process of getting use to the menu but it seemed that if that was the case, the server could have fired the next course a little sooner so the kitchen would have that much more time to prepare.  The tables around us did seem to be receiving their courses in a more timely manner.  During the course of our meal, our water glasses were never refilled nor were we ever asked if we would like our other beverages refilled.  \n\nAfter we were done with the entrees, our server returned to ask us if we would like to look at the dessert menu, as we were about to respond believing that we would be able to at least share a dessert since we were told at the beginning of the meal that we would, our server proceeded to tell us that some parties were getting dessert and some were not.  And that we were one of the ones that was not going to be receiving dessert but that he would send out a chocolate plate.  We were a little dumbfounded being that we were told at the beginning of the meal that we would get dessert also because we questioned, why ask if we wanted to see the dessert menu just to tell us that we would not be allowed to order dessert?  After another 20 minutes, nothing ever came out.  Someone came by and cleared our water glasses before even checking to see if we were done with our meal.  Our server finally came back with a bill fold and thanked us for coming in.  At this point, we didn't see a reason to ask about the chocolate that was offered, paid our tip and left.\n\nAs for the ambiance, it is a very nice open floor plan.  It had many levels and seemed like a great place to see or be seen.  But, it was also almost the exact same d\u00e9cor as it's predecessors.  I would have like to see Bagatelle make the space their own and change things up a touch.  \n\nAll and all, I do hope that our experience was not a reflection of the standards at Bagatelle.  We are considering going back after a few months to see if things are a bit more streamlined.", "business_id": "6UGAtEw8TH6J6YeRRZpwKg", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-11-15", "type": "review"}

My first interaction with the hostess was not very pleasurable,\nI went into the restaurant at 1120a and they didn't open till 1130a. Gasp.\nI wanted to sit down, grab a glass of wine and read Creative Loafing and wait for my girlfriend.  Let me just say I was denied access. \n\n I know I have a lot of nerve showing up so early and before anyone explains to me the inner workings of a restaurant, I supported myself, full time, non-stop as a waitress for twenty years.  Let's just say good thing the food was delicious or I would have not been back.  Finally when the hostess saw fit to sit the now three tables at the door, she walked me to my table. \n\n I sat down and ordered a glass of Prosecco, it came a little flat, I thought,  BOOOOO, but I couldn't complain, it would just be in bad form.  I drank my flat sparkling, I have had worse.  We started with basil rolls and chicken Larb.  The basil rolls were fresh and the dipping sauce was the perfect sweetness with a tiny kick of spicy chile paste.  I have only had Chicken Larb served chilled like a salad, this Larb,  the chicken was freshly cooked and served room temperature. Larb is usually a meat concoction of mint leaves, chili, onion, rice powder\nin lime juice and fish sauce.  We also shared some chicken red curry, it was great, how can you go wrong with coconut milk and red curry?   \n\nMy second visit I went at a more suitable hour of 1p, so I didn't get any\nlip from the hostess.  We had basil rolls again, shrimp fried in egg roll\nwrappers and Pad Thai, everything is fresh and the heat index is perfect, you can ask for chili sauce and make dishes as spicy as you like.  I love this restaurant, I think I would go on off hours or weeknights or expect a wait, the restaurant only sits about 75 people. It is priced reasonable at lunch, with a bottle of wine our bill for two was $60, half of that was the wine.  If you haven't eaten Thai food, I would recommend going with two or more people so you can order a lot of food and try a lot of different items.\n\nSo far, everything I have had has been off the charts fresh and scrumptious.  I feel like everyone is allowed to have a bad day, maybe I could make sure I am really nice next time I go in there, maybe she won't remember me as that customer that came in too early.  I would rather be known as that lady who drinks at 1132a.\n\nBasil Thai gets a 3 corndog rating.", "business_id": "DtrACWjoGtx4lAaNfxHS4A", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-01-15", "type": "review"}

Their beer selection was amazing: craft brews - most of them on draft but some options in a can as well. They carried some of our favorites: Dogfish Head 90-minute IPA, Bells Two-Hearted, Dale's Pale Ale.  If I remember correctly, prices ranged from $5-8...not terrible and plenty of them were priced at the lower end of the range.They have a very short list of house cocktails (4 or 5) for the non-beer drinkers but I thought they sounded delicious and for a moment I was tempted to order a cocktail instead.\n\nI ordered the Thai Brat with apricot onion chutney. I had been warned that it would be spicy since it contained sriracha but I like some heat so I ordered it anyway. The mix of sweet and spicy was nice, but I will admit that 3/4 of my way through it I had to hand the rest over to my husband -- too spicy. It was almost so spicy that I feared I was missing out on some really good flavors going on in there, but I still enjoyed it. He ordered the Spicy Brat with sauerkraut. The brat was not as spicy as the Thai brat but it was delicious. The bar was lined with ketchup, mustard, curry ketchup, honey mustard, whole grain mustard, and dijon mustard. My husband was happy because he used curry ketchup at home. I like regular ketchup so much that I normally don't use it but it was a nice addition to the Thai Brat.\n\nFries? A-MAZING! A small order was plenty to split but I could've eaten a large just because it's so hard to stop eating them. You are given a choice of about 8 dipping sauces. We had the bacon bleu-cheese, but all of the options sounded great so it was a tough choice.\n\nWe splurged and got dessert.

I even heard that you can't walk dogs on the Strip because they wanted to keep the peddlers and their dogs off Las Vegas Boulevard. \n\nTherefore, trying to find a dog-friendly restaurant will require you to leave the Strip and head over to the more residential areas of Vegas. Perusing the Yelp app, that is how the wife and I stumbled upon Honey Salt, a glorious restaurant in the Summerlin part of northwest Las Vegas that feels like Palm Springs, CA... complete with wealthy white people and golf courses.\n\nLike morons, we decided to do a late lunch with our four-legged son, Charlie, in the hot desert that encompasses Las Vegas. Blame our stupidity or the fact that we are so used to taking him around with us everywhere in Southern California that we did not realize how fucking hot it gets in Las Vegas. That is why when we arrived at Honey Salt, their spacious patio was empty. However, almost immediately, one of their workers, Mauro, came out and set up a patio umbrella for us to shade us from the hot desert sun. I'm sure he was thinking, stupid tourists! \n\nAs we were waiting for the umbrella to be set up, our mindful server, Louis, brought out a bowl of water filled with ice cubes for Charlie! He even brought out two glasses and a pitcher of ice water for the dumb humans! First impressions go a long way and we were definitely impressed. \n\nWe ended up ordering two of the \"Family Favorites\" off their lunch menu. The Mary's Free Range Chicken ($15) and the Ahi Tuna Salad ($17). \n\nThe Mary's Free Range Chicken is served with red and white quinoa, beluga lentils, shaved fennel, radish, avocado chunks, and a citrus vinaigrette. While the chicken was very good, the grains definitely stole the show. This hearty conception was delicious and the citrus vinaigrette made it really refreshing. True to their name the citrus vinaigrette provided the \"honey\" and the grains provided the \"salt\".\n\nThe Ahi Tuna Salad was equally amazing. Yes, the wasabi pea and ginger crusted ahi tuna was great and the baby spinach with cream soy vinaigrette was delicious. However, the real star was the sea beans and julienned Asian pears salad mixed in what was a sesame kind of sauce. This single salad had both \"honey\" from the sweet Asian pears and \"salt\" from the sea beans. Freaking awesome.\n\nAll in all, the service and the fresh farm-to-table food was really impressive. It's definitely a hidden gem in the Las Vegas desert. Next time the family is in Vegas, we will wait for the sun to go down so that Mauro won't have to break a sweat for us.\n\n* The complimentary Parmesan crisps served with honey butter were very addicting and they have an extensive beer selection.\n\n* Honey Salt is located in the inconspicuous Rampart Commons shopping center with a Chico's, Gap, and Pottery Barn at the northwest corner of Rampart and Charleston. If exiting the Rampart exit off the Summerlin Parkway, the shopping center will be on the right.\n\n* Honey Salt must be doing something right because they will be opening up another restaurant in the Summerlin area!", "business_id": "25fxw_jOqZtJwl18cCarIA", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-06-16", "type": "review"}

I'm not a huge fan of buffets but after hearing there were over 500 items to chose from & it being the largest buffet in the world (according to the girl who worked there) & seeing all the delicious pics on Yelp, I just knew I had to eat here. \n\nWe arrived around 730pm on a Tuesday. There's a kiosk machine where you check-in. You punch in how many people are in your party. Put in your cell number and you'll receive a text telling you to come back and get in line. On the ticket the wait said it was 45 mins but I got a text within 10 mins and we went to stand in line. I estimated we probably waited less than 30 mins. The host said the best time to go is between 4pm - 5pm, food for thought.\n\nNow on to the food. I really was going to attempt to eat as much protein and seafood as possible. I wasn't going to waste any stomach space on carbs. First station - meat, they had brisket, lamb, spicy sausage and a couple of others I can't remember what they were. I decided to go for the lamb since I never had it before and also the spicy sausage and brisket. I was surprised the lamb was pretty good & not gamey as I thought it would be. Not a fan of it though. The brisket was tender and the spicy sausage was helluva good. Oh I also tried the hamburger sliders which have little sticks on it telling you how it's cooked. Just ate the meat and not the bread lol, it was pretty good.\n\nNext on to seafood. Went for the crab legs and boy did I pig out on that. I didn't know where they steamed crab legs were until after I ate the cold ones but what the heck went and got them anyway. It's way in the back by the way, near the Japanese section. You give the cook your plate and they sure pile up the crab legs, they aren't stingy either. If I didn't have high cholesterol then I do now. Oh and btw, there's a video on a Yelp showing you how to open the claws. Thank you to the nice person who posted that. My friend kept telling me if I ate a whole plate of crab legs then I got my money's worth and yes I did - twice. \n\nI also tried the fried chicken and waffles, well just the chicken anyway & it was pretty darn good. The only veggie I tried was the corn on the cob. I decided to try the Tonkotsu Ramen and surprisingly it tasted like something I would get in Japan. It comes in a small bowl and the noodles were cooked perfect. \n\nSo I know y'all are dying to know about the desserts. Well there's a lot. I tried almost everything that was chocolate except for ice cream. I think I was bouncing off the walls from all the sugar. I'm not a dessert person but all desserts looked so stinking good that I just had to try it. They had mini cakes, cup cakes, macaroons, ice cream and they even had mochi ice cream. You name it, they probably had it. \n\nI will definitely go back here the next time I'm in Vegas.

Officially this pizza shop doesn't have a name...\n\nMany a Yelper have just accidentally stumbled onto this pizza place in the Cosmopolitian en route to something else. Unlike them, I cheated, using Yelp and the Internet to do the dirty work for me. It also helps that I saw other people just randomly going into the 3rd floor with whole pizza boxes. Once you hit the 3rd floor, look between Jaleo (the Spanish place) and Blue Ribbon (sushi) for a small hallway filled with records.\n\nThe pizza place is supposed to be small and simple; No1DP notes that it's reminiscent of the pizza joints he used to frequent back in NY/NJ. There's seating and counter space only for ~5 people and there's only 2 pinball games. The concept's really simple: pick pizza for slice or customize a whole pie. \n\nNo1DP was craving pizza as Japan really doesn't know how to do a good pizza. I was there for another reason: to try the concoction known as \"white pie\".\nCrust: Thin and crunchy, which the No1DP says is the way to do a New York-style pizza. The pizza gets cold quickly so eat it while you can. No1DP says that this is why you see people eat this pizza fast - there's not much crust to absorb the heat.\n-Veggie Supreme: Came to ~$8.00/slice as he had lots of toppings. He says that this is the best pizza he's had in a while and can easily put this in the top 10 pizza joints he's visited.\n-White Pie ($5.50): The No1DP said to me that each pizza joint does their white pie differently, but in essence this is a cheese pizza with NO tomato sauce. When fresh off the oven the cheese is stringy but it held together well. I really liked the garlic and they are generous with the ricotta - this soft cheese literally just melts in your mouth! \n\nDefinitely a must for late night eating, especially if you've been clubbing all day!", "business_id": "eq6lQI039SBLC6sHm3idGA", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-10-02", "type": "review"}

We really enjoyed the old school pub vibe this place gives off.  All of the table tops and bar are made of old wood recycled from factories.  This gave it a cool cozy feeling.  They have a decent selection of beers and I was excited to find out they currently have an orange blossom pilsner from Thomas Creek Brewery out of Greenville, SC.  I fell in love with this beer months ago and haven't been able to find it since.  We ordered \"heavy\" italian sausages with chilli, cheese, peppers, and onions.  The toppings were scrumptious but the sausage itself tasted a little off.  Overall it was still enjoyable.  Our waitress was great and very knowledgeable about the different beers.  Her descriptions of the beers were quite impressive.  Growler's has the potential to make the list of bars/restaurants we take visitors to.", "business_id": "o5Me8uSqyUSm8U3aEMAbSA", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-09-10", "type": "review"}

I realized he has a restaurant in LV a few years ago, but wasn't able to dine there...so I made it a mission to dine there this time!\n\nAs usual...I made reservations through OpenTable. I arrived with my party 15 minutes early. They had us wait for our reservation time. I thought that was strange... I never ran into a situation where a restaurant would not seat you early. Once we were seated...I looked around and saw the dinning are was pretty much empty. So my question is.....why did I have to wait 15 minutes??\n\nThe menu is tapas style. It's similar to the way the Asian culture eats, but portions are a lot smaller...and more expensive. My expectations were very high. We ordered the special which included a 3 course meal and 4 tapas.\n\nFor the 3 course--fish tacos, filet mignon, and creme brulee.\nFor the 4 tapas--foie gras, corn soup, scallops, and octopus.\n\nThe most memorable were the foie, corn, scallops, and creme. In the foie, you could taste the love and attention put on the plate. From the sauce to the sorbet...it was something I have never had before. The corn soup was the equivalent to the lobster bisque at Capital Grille. Creamy and light, but you definitely have to share if you want to try other things! The scallops came with a bowl of smoke covering it. You could taste the smoke and sweetness of the scallop. There was also tomato water...smells like tomato, but doesn't really have a taste. The creme brulee was hands down the best I have had so far. Smooth and light. I did not feel guilty afterwards!\n\nThe low of the meal was the octopus. It was tender, but really salty and the sauce reminded me of jarred pasta sauce. (Sorry! But it's the truth...) I wish I ordered the shrimp dish instead.\n\nService was great. Food was spectacular. I think they need to dust out the place because halfway through dinner, my allergies kicked up. I wish there was more light (just my personal preference).

I really recommend any of their dry-aged beef ($45-65), as the Wagyu is a little too outrageous for a simple steak dinner ($90-$110). \n\nMy second time was with a group of three others for my twenty-sixth birthday.

I've had the opportunity to visit 3 times now. Twice for lunch, and once for dinner. \n\nLet me start out by saying, the primary focus of a restaurant should always be the food. You are going to eat. \n\nBut the secondary focus is the experience. The reason you pay more, and leave a tip is for the experience. \n\nI can say, hands down, every single Pita Jungle I visit, the food is extraordinary, and the service is awful. \n\nLet's start with the latter, so we can end on a high note. They have a very relaxed vibe, which can sometimes make it hard to figure out who is a server, and who is just looking for the bathrooms. They dress like a hipsters paradise, which is fine, but at the very least a name tag, or apron would REALLY help when trying to track down a server. \n\nMore recently when I visited for dinner with my folks, we had a young lady, who I assume was named \"Karma\" based on her necklace. She was nice enough. I arrived separate from my parents, so she brought me a drink. I had to flag her down to order an appetizer. Once my parents arrived,  she brought them their drinks and we literally did not see her again for 15 minutes. Not anywhere. She either has an invisibility cloak, or was trying to eat or... something. When we finally ordered, it took another 20 minutes for our food to arrive (1 soup, and 1 pesto pasta?). To her credit, she did refill my fathers lemonade multiple times, and brought him a \"fresh one\" when it looked watered down. But this was par for the course. I warned my folks about the lackluster service. \n\nNow for the food. Everything I have ever had a Pita Jungle has been wonderful. I love the Red Pepper Hummus, as well as the Cilantro Jalapeno. Occasionally the pitas are a bit stale, but at 50 cents a pop, I can't complain. My \"go-to\" order is the Falafel Hot Pita. It's majestic. All the flavor you could ask for. (though once they forgot the Tahini and it was dry as all heck but still flavorful) I also recently fell in love with the Pesto Pasta. The right amount of Heavy to fill me up, the the right amount of light so I don't feel FULL. \n\nAll in all, if they could imrpove their service, even just slightly, I'd bump them another star.", "business_id": "z7wUzllCnzHVuNzMQw43Hw", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-07-30", "type": "review"}

They had a hint of sesame oil that went very well with the spices. Portion size was adequate but not particularly generous as you may find in Sakana.\n\nThe 2 Salmon Sashimi & 1 Tuna Sashimi were also delicious; the fish was very fresh and the wasabi used here is better than at most places.

The table was sticky, as might happen if using the same rag to 'go over' a table and call it clean. We told our waitress that the table was sticky right after we had sat down with our menus; she was super nice and moved us to another table that was less sticky but still had that film. We thanked her.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nI might give this place a try further down the road, with a $25 certificate and if I'm allowed to sit outside and brave the elements. Had I paid full price for this meal, I would be upset. You can go to Sakana and get a better deal in terms of quality, quantity and ambiance. But maybe the Chinese fusion side is something really special in this restaurant and I just didn't try it.. Okay, I might try a Chinese dish next time... to go.", "business_id": "jFoLuxZFScgt5ZXNPTIOhg", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-08-25", "type": "review"}

First we started with an assortment of meats, cheeses and olives dish for the table, and it was fantastic.  The Caesar salad and dressing was from a homemade recipe that was truly one of the best I have had.  For one of our guests by request they added anchovies to the top. We had a party of 10 with different entrees from Pizza, a lobster, seafood and pasta dish,  Mussels which were so good that one in our group doubled the order and had it for the main course.  I had the Beef tenderloin with a cream sauce that was just amazing.  Others in our group had the pizza and said it was outstanding.

Family owned, and with New York origins, this place was super cute, super clean, super delicious and super fresh. We ordered the Greek salad which was very fresh and crisp, the calamari which was so light and fresh and just downright delicious, the bucket of chicken wings (which did not come in a bucket but were instead served in a nicer oblong plate with the creamiest ranch dressing on the side) and the Russo's supreme pizza to which we added olives, ham, and jalapenos for a dollar each. All our appetizers were so light and fresh, that it really made the difference while we waited for our pizza. Usually appetizers will sit heavy and then by the time your entree comes, you don't really have room for more food, but not here, and I really think it's due to the way the food was prepared. Just as you would expect from a small, authentic, family-owned restaurant, our food was made with utmost attention and the freshest ingredients. I would give this place 5 stars if only our pizza order hadn't been messed up. While we had ordered a supreme with added toppings, when our pizza came out, it only had the 3 added toppings we had asked be added. Our server without hesitation immediately apologized and took it from us with a real \"We're gonna make this right\" attitude which we really appreciated. We would've been happy if the other toppings had been cooked aside and just tossed on our pizza, because not gonna lie, we were eager to eat it! But the chef made us an entirely new pizza, and he did so super quickly! We felt bad because our pizza was huge and we were worried the first pizza was gonna get tossed but when we asked for our to go box, our server boxed our left overs and came back with the first pizza in a box as well and we were so relieved because perfectly good food shouldn't be thrown out! Of course we weren't charged for the first pizza and now we have dinner for the rest of the week! haha.

Mad Greek serves other classic favorites such as burgers and pastrami sandwiches besides their famed gyro. Apparently there are several Mad Greek locations all centralized near or around Las Vegas. Here's the dealio:\n\nHave been here twice within a span of two days. I went to the one in Baker as well. The first time to check it out, and since I wasn't hungry enough for a gyro, I got a strawberry milkshake, a pistachio baklava, and a spanakopita to go (yes, definitely wasn't hungry). Here I was expecting to be knocked off my feet and my socks rocked the hell off by the shake ('cause apparently my mom has tried it before and loved it--she rarely likes food). It tasted...not really like a strawberry milkshake. The strawberry flavor was completely off and tasted very bland. Ok, way to mess up a strawberry shake.\n\nThe pistachio baklava was all right, but had way too much syrup in one layer, so you ended up with this effect of an imbalanced, overpowering sweetness as you chewed through the pastry. The spanakopita...well I have had much better back in the Bay.\n\nThe second time I came back I tried the gyro, and my mom ordered the chicken gyro. The fries were soggy and not crispy. The gyro meat, yogurt sauce and rice were all ridiculously overloaded with salt. Not sure how people could stand that level of sodium on their pallet. I wolfed it down despite the saltiness, my determination to finish it driven only by the price (10 bucks) I paid for it; the gyro was, in fact, a huge disappointment. I love gyros and have tried a number of them, but this one was definitely far off from being the \"Best Gyro in the USA.\" The chicken gyro was actually quite tasty and less salty.\n\nAs the juicy cherry on top of my whole experience here, the prices were ridiculously pricey. Almost 5 bucks for a shake; 10 bucks for the gyro and rice or fries, 4 bucks for a fruit cup that didn't even taste fresh or sweet, etc.\n\nExtra star for the interesting decor and funny ass signs posted around the place. \n\nI may return in the future to try out the fried zucchini, but until then Mad Greek you make me sad.", "business_id": "CF3dd_PNGAjK_Lo0eETTUA", "stars": 2, "date": "2008-12-30", "type": "review"}

I got a bit confused.. but I sat down anyways.\n\nWe got seated about 10 minutes later.

That's my only complaint. There's just a lot of saucy stuff going on there... I put the wasabi mayo on but I actually would have preferred to have it without it. But that fried egg and juicy meat.. god, it was gold! The one thing that I really liked about the burger was the sweet hamburger bun. Not like your average bun. Light fluffy and a good compliment to all the ingrediants in the burger.\n\nThe fries were craziness. We ordered the sweet potato fries and the truffle parmasean fries.

We read some reviews before trying and people basically love the ribs. Some complained about the guy behind the counter being surly and that it is a hole in the wall. Well, we expected a \"Soup Nazi\" experience and the main problem was that their television echoes through the place while the soft-spoken guy, positioned about 30 feet away at the oven, asks what you want with soft-spoken voice. I felt badly saying \"What?\" so many times but finally got the order straight. He was very patient with us.\n\nAfter tasting the magnificent ribs, we told him that these were the best ribs we'd ever tasted (also over the dratted television noise). The guy was positively beaming and we had a nice conversation with him. He said the recipe has been in the family for 140 years so far. He also said that the style was Louisiana BBQ. I had mild and my brother-in-law had hot. We were both extremely satisfied. There was plenty of meat on the ribs and they were done to perfection. They did not have cole slaw but we did try potato salad--very good too!\n\nThe ambiance is nothing to write home about, but it seemed good enough.

We look over the menu, classic German fair (schnitzel, sausage, etc) I ordered the Jaeger Schnitzel and a side of Red Cabbage. While waiting for my food, (enjoying a Warsteiner Pilnser on tap!!) I took notice to all the decor. The German flags, the US flag and all the Berlin posters was a real nice touch of ambiance. The waiter came over to check on us numerous times to see how we were doing. Then he brings the food out. GOOD GOD! Talk about a feast for the gods, my schnitzel was cooked perfect. The gravy that come on it was also perfect. Flavorful and delicious! The red cabbage was also cooked to perfection. Takes me back to when I was a child, eating German food with my family. After I was done with my entree, I had to order the strudel (apple) and wow, it was amazing. Talk about putting the cherry on the sundae. It was a perfect ending to an amazing meal.

Well, no more...\nWent last Saturday night and I seriously thought it had new owners. The dirty truth...\nService:\nTerrible, terrible service. From the host, to the bartender, to the server, we received rushed, unfriendly, inattentive treatment. When entrees are in the $20+ range I expect better service than what I've experienced at most fast food joints. \nFood: \nWho stopped caring in the kitchen? It used to feel like the food was lovingly made by a gourmet Mexican grandma. Now it was just slopped on the plate. We ordered the table side guac and it was thrown together so fast and the server didn't even take the time to ask how we wanted it (spice, mild, etc.). It was fine but not as special as on previous visits. My favorite seasonal dish is the Chilis en Nogada - a whole chili stuffed with chicken and dried fruits with a creamy almond sauce and fresh pomegranates. In this past, this dish was dreamy! On this night it was a nightmare. Dried out chicken, bland chile, and so sweet it was barely edible. Also, it was served with a side of cold unseasoned steamed zucchini and bland mashed potatoes that added absolutely nothing to the dish.

I used to work close by and was excited for them to open as there aren't a ton of healthy options in the area aside from Wildflower (which is always packed during lunch). The first time I went, I tried the Southwest, which is delicious. It came in a container the size of a chinese take-out container. When they first opened, they only had smoothies. I think it confused a lot of people that their tagline was food + juice but they didn't have actual juice. I forgot which smoothie I got but remember it being kind of icey and just OK.\n\nI later went back on a hot summer day and tried their Energy juice which has pineapple, mint, coconut water, and apple. It was so good. I could probably drink that everyday. It's so light and refreshing!\n\nThis past time I decided to try their South Beach and got the Energy again. The South Beach's vinaigrette was a bit too much for me. I should have asked for it on the side. My boyfriend got the Boost juice. It was good but not very sweet. If it had apple or some other kind of sugary fruit in it, it would have been better for us. \n\nTheir prices are a little higher than similar places. However, it's because they use organic ingredients. If you're wondering if they're actually a healthy place or a fake healthy place, you can go to their website to view nutrition information. $10 for a salad is pricey for me and not something I would do frequently. If organic is important to you, paying more wouldn't be a big deal.

Virtually everything can come with their delicious, buttery crepe pancakes, which are thin and amazing, or their lyonaise potatoes, which are outstanding, especially if you are a potato lover like myself. There are a lot of other good choices, like the Tex Mex omelet or the Croissant French Toast, and as I said above the prices are pretty good. The layout is odd and there is a lot of kitschy board games and such on the wall that kind of make it fun and different.\n\nThere are a few drawbacks. Their hours are short, and I've not found the help to be especially attentive. Not bad, mind you, just not especially attentive. Also, they only take cash, which is a pain when you don't typically carry cash.\n\nThis place is good enough that it is usually the first stop when we have visitors from out of town.", "business_id": "m_9QMfvVYFKsxPjlkCvZqA", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-09-23", "type": "review"}

Well, Phoenix, I understand now. I have seen the light. You have converted me to Ciboism.\n\nIt's. Phenomenal.\n\nThe location is in a neighborhood and it's obviously a converted house where the outdoor seating is actually on the front lawn with some nice lights in the trees. Very cool to sit outside on a cool night in Phoenix and enjoy great company and delicious food!\n\nWhen I was looking at the menu I was so excited to see so many options for Pizza Biancha (white pizza!). I can't eat tomatoes so it was like a kid in a candy store for me. Once I saw the Di Notte I knew it had to be mine. A huge portion, wood fired pizza with fontina, pecorino, gorgonzola and mozzarella cheeses along with spicy salami. It was to die for. I enjoyed it at the table AND I enjoyed the leftovers. My co-workers even stole a slice each and couldn't stop ooo'ing and aah'ing over it.\n\nOne of my co-workers got a meatball sub which he swore up and down was as good as his authentic-from-Italy grandmother's. He said it might be sacriledge to say it, but it was true. My other co-worker had a half vegetarian and half ham and she said the whole thing was delicious.\n\nFor dessert, even though we were full, we couldn't pass up the opportunity to try the Nutella & Marscapone crepe. It was a warm crepe filled with nutella and marscapone cheese, covered in powdered sugar and drizzled with chocolate sauce, with a dollop of ice cream. It was sinfully delicious.\n\nI completely agree that this might be the best pizza I've ever had!!

I really liked the steak last time.  With the closing of the Pittsburgh Chophouse in Robinson, I had no other alternative known to myself.  After finding our parking spot and being seated, I was ready to order rather quickly.  On the menu:\n\nPotato Soup\nShrimp cocktail\nFilet Mignon (12oz, medium-rare) with green beans and cheddar-bacon-smashed potatoes\nIced Tea with Lemon and Water\n\nWe received that soup, some rolls and butter, and our drinks rather quickly and everything seemed to be on point.  Someone must have read my last review because the rolls were now fully cooked with a hint of sage on top.  Add some real whipped butter to that warm roll and I was pleased.  The soup was another story.  I was told that they cooked the potatoes with beer, but it just wasn't meshing.  I had a big brown potato chunk in the soup and the flavor of the entire bowl was just off.\n\nSome time later, our shrimp cocktail arrived.  For the price, the presentation, size, and quantity of shrimp was fairly poor.  Luckily, the shrimp were not dipped in Old Bay Seasoning prior to bringing them to the table.  Even though they now tasted good, I doubt I will get them again unless the size of the shrimp or the quantity is elevated.\n\nSome time later, we received our entree.  The steak was cooked a Pittsburgh rare -- dark brown on the outside and refrigerator cold on the inside.  I was a tad perturbed due to my request for medium-rare; but the fact that I still liked it and ate it speaks volumes for the caliber of meat that they use at Mantini's.  The green beans were still inedible, but I could actually tasted the potatoes in the smashed potatoes this time.\n\nWith this visit, I will no longer get anything but the steak, the bread, a drink and possibly try some different appetizers.  Nothing else is really worth the price tag or the flavor.", "business_id": "YiJbDWMD7vv52p1mkTYM4w", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-10-16", "type": "review"}

I come just as much for the EXPERIENCE. \n\nMy BF was visiting from SF and I thought it would be a fun to try out something new together. We called for reservations on a Saturday night. 'Sorry,' they said, 'they were booked, but stop by since there were communal tables.' We went there around 8p and to our surprise, we were seated almost immediately (thanks!) We were so glad we didn't have any plans after too, because this meal was 2 hours or so and every bite was perfect. We had to wait a bit for the food, but hey, when the company is great, who cares? \n\nWe couldn't decide on what to get so we decided to share a few small plates and an entree- best decision we made that night. We shared the escolar (my fave!), peach (i think), sweet breads, snails, and for the entree, the trout. At first I was uneasy about the 'general-ness' of the plates as I'm used to hearing all about how something is made before I decide. But all of that melted away as soon as I had my first bite.  Everything was so delish! Even with the trout that was prepared with few textures (I'm a textures girl) I completely appreciated the artistic expression of the chef and their craft. All the flavors were deconstructed, so every bite had a different taste to appreciate. Each chef also prepares the plates with their own flare, so no two plates will be the same. Salt is a place where you can trust your chefs!\n\nIt seemed that our server planned each dish to complement the one prior and after because when we ordered the dishes, the server had suggested the order of our meal so we knew what was coming and when- I wish I had the server's name but thanks for the experience! \n\nI've been back about a month after this and the menu was slightly modified.

Unlike the other steakhouses located on the strip, the Prime is one of those classy restaurant that caters to the sophisticated diner with high expectations in service and the quality of the food. Reservations are strongly recommended and an evening in this restaurant will set you back a minimum of $250 for two people. \n\nOverview: I have visited at this restaurant a total of 3 times in the past several months and I was never once disappointed. The service is outstanding and they will generally try to work with the customer to provide the best possible dining experience. One of the Prime's main selling point is that they feature dry aged beef that has been aged for over 30 days for the best possible flavor. They also have a varied selection of wines to compliment your dinner. \n\nPROS: An enjoyable and sophisticated atmosphere, excellent staff, and quality cuts of beef. \n\nCONS: The restaurant has a dress code posted requiring dinner jackets for men. However, that dress code is loosely enforced. I have seen some guests come in with a dress shirt and jeans. \n\nRestaurant Class: Lower-Upper \n\nFood: (4 out of 5 stars) The steaks are well prepared and cooked to order. And the dry aged ribeye do not disappoint. Any steak you order in this restaurant will be a quality cut of beef. The side dishes were also surprisingly good. They are also large enough to be shared. The only negative thing I noticed about the steaks was that it was a bit on the salty side for my palliate. But that can be easily remedied by ordering your steak with less salt or unsalted. \n\nAtmosphere: (4 out of 5 stars) If you are celebrating a special occasion or just want to have a romantic dinner, this restaurant is definitely for you. The atmosphere is relaxing yet vibrant enough to keep your attention; and the mood is sophisticated, yet subtle enough to have a little fun. Lastly, you can never go wrong with a window seat overlooking the Bellagio fountains. \n\nCleanliness: (4.5 out of 5 stars) The entire dining room is kept virtually spotless and comfortable. The tables are cleaned frequently with fresh linens and table cloths. \n\nService: (4 out of 5 stars) The staffs are all absolute professionals. They know their jobs and they know what the customer expects out of them. In fact, they are so detailed oriented that they will give the gentlemen wearing a dark suit a black linen instead of a white one. \n\nRestroom Facilities: (3.5 out of 5 stars) Despite this restaurant's location, it does have it's own facilities. And like the dinning room, the restrooms are kept relatively clean and well stocked. Additionally, the men's room also comes with complimentary amenities like lotion or hair cell.", "business_id": "Bt7lGzIlPGc13iCXoc-TIw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-09-06", "type": "review"}

I believe the wonton soup was about tops that I've had, with no skimping on wonton, meat, onion/scallion bits, or especially flavor.\nI let them know that since they offer plenty of choices for non-spicy chicken (S&S, lemon, orange, pineapple) that they could notch up the spiciness on their General Tso's a bit.\n\nI will return to Tasty House, despite their bleak location, whether they pretty it up or not.  As long as the quality, portions, and flavor I had remain consistent this could become a four star regular cheap lunch for me, but if they did pretty up the digs, I'm sure a lot of others would feel that way, too.", "business_id": "UK2LezJRdrNkmF_TH__rCg", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-12-23", "type": "review"}

I plan to come here regularly as long as I live in Phoenix. Before I go on to expound upon the wonders of my first dining experience here, I need to make a brief but passionate comment about the location of this restaurant. I agree that Poncho's  is a gem, but I think it does a disservice to the residents of this area to think of Poncho's as good *given the area*. Part of what makes restaurants like Poncho's so great is that they are family-run, with the passion and experience of many generations fueling their current success. In my limited time here, South Phoenix strikes me as an area that has a lot of heart and soul to it - a lot of the homes in the neighborhood have been in the family for generations, and certain restaurants here reflect this sense of the past and of community. I loved my first experience at Poncho's because it's such a great dining experience with real ties to the South Phoenix community, not in spite of this fact. \n\nOK, that being said, on to the food and drink! We started with thin, crispy, perfectly salted chips with some hot salsa in a bottle - best starter ever! We ordered margaritas, and our waitress (who was really down-to-earth and helpful) asked if we wanted the \"big bowl\" ones. \"Hmmm, why not,\" we said (they were priced at $6.50, which is really reasonable). And we didn't regret our choice! They were a little sweet for my taste, but they still had a really great lime flavor and tasted pretty strong. Much better than the limeade Los Dos Molinos tries to pass off as margarita mix! And once we had them along with the chips, the mix started to taste less sweet and became the perfect compliment to the spice of the salsa. \n\nWhen we first saw the prices of the food, we were shocked! It was so cheap! It's really impressive that the owners have managed to keep the quality and portions so high while keeping prices so low. Based on Yelp reviews, I recommended to my husband that he try the Pollo Fundido (~$7). I tried two a la carte items - the chile relleno w/ chicken (~$5) and the shredded beef enchilada ($3.50). Everything was so rich but so good! The fried shell and the jalapeno cream cheese on the Pollo were so satisfying, the enchilada sauce was really flavorful, and the chicken was moist. The beans and rice were also really good. We enjoyed every minute of our entrees, which we continued to wash down with the margaritas. \n\nWe left feeling full but satisfied, and we definitely look forward to coming back soon (perhaps for happy hour or to sit in the cantina, which was really lively). Thank you, Poncho's! I'm glad you exist!", "business_id": "14NSxaXBNspIVnsrMYJZVw", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-06-08", "type": "review"}

The Yard House is a fun place for groups of friends to hang out over beer and good food. The restaurant does a commendable job accommodating large groups. Both times that I went to the Yard House we had no problem getting a large table. The service is precise. And when it is time to pay, we had our own checks. Substitute Yelpers for a gathering of general friends, or a date and the Yard House is everybody's social house.\n\n  The Yard House is my choice chain restaurant for beer selection. The Yard House is to beer what Baskin Robbins is to ice cream. Whereas Baskin Robbins features 31 flavors of ice cream,, the Yard House features approximately 600 flavors of beer (I counted the beer listed in the menu). If I were to go to the Yard House one Friday a week to order a flavor of beer, according to my math it would take me 12 years to done this. Or if I were to go to the Yard House everyday to try a flavor of beer, it would take me 2 years to do this. Some of the beers may have been listed under a couple of different headings. The deal is that the Yard House selection of beer is as good as it gets. \n\n  There are eleven series of beer. There is the chalkboard series. The cider series is the seasonals. The light beer is less than 5.8% alcohol content. This series includes many of the name brands such as Michelob and Budweiser. There is the Honey Fruit series which includes BBC Strawberry Blonde and Blue Point Blueberry. There is the wheat series that includes Blue Hawaiin Hefeweizen. The Malty series includes Bass Ale and Alaskin Amber. The Dark series includes Big Sky Moose Drool and Bison Organic Chocolate. The bitter series includes Anchor Liberty and Blue Point Hoptical Illusion. And there is the Strong and Effervescent series. The menu lists the alcohol content. Unless I overlooked something, the Allagash Curieux is the strongest at 11% alcohol content. There are three sizes of beer. I went for the middle size which is the pint. For the record I greatly appreciated the Firestone.\n\n  This very Yard House features a Happy Hour and Late Night Specials. The Happy Hour is Monday-Friday 3-6 pm and Late Night Special Sunday-Wednesday 10-close. They include domestic pints from $4.25-$5.75, well drinks $4.27-$4.75 and wine by glass $2 off. If you are up to food there are half price appetizers & pizza.\n\n  The food is good but I've tasted better. My complaint about the roasted turkey club is that it was layers of sandwich instead of the sandwich I am accustomed to. The classic cheeseburger was a good choice. The fries are these skinny things that remind me of potato sticks. I feel that the Yard House ought to expand their fries selection to include steak fries and just thicker fries.\n\n  When I socialize at a restaurant, I am big on the music that is playing. I was won over by the music playing. I heard great music from Led Zeppelin, the Rolling Stones and classic rock era.\n\n  The Yard House excells at their selection of beer. Whether it is my Yelp House or social House I intend to return. When I return I plan to try the Blue Point Blueberry beer that is brewed in Blue Point, NY; 5 miles south of where I lived. Gotta be patriotic to my home town.\n\nDaniel. S Yelp 100 Challenge. Review 72", "business_id": "j_pce4pG9krrBeYwUni8Pg", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-04-24", "type": "review"}

It is quite loud and I would find it difficult to have an intimate dinner.  However, it is perfect for family and kids and should warrant a visit if you are vacationing with family/friends.  \n\n-For the kids they have a live steer as you are walking in (just warrants a quick look), a slide (kids absolutely love it) and some old fashioned video games.  \n\n-For the adults there is a dance floor with live country music, and REALLY GOOD FOOD!  Everyone in our party loved their food, even the vegetarian (I know how cruel can we be to bring a vegetarian to a BBQ joint).  I shared one of those GIGANTIC meals for 2 or more with a friend, and each item (ribs, chicken, shrimp, etc) was somehow falling off the bone with amazing flavor.\n\n-The only compliant I had was the service was a little off the longer we stayed.  When we first got there the service was amazing, someone stopped by our table every 5-10 minutes.

We stumbled upon East Blvd Bar and Grill. We had an amazing female bartender that was all smiles and very personable. She happily put a game we wanted on a side TV for us and talked to us throughout the afternoon. I watched her make bloody mary after bloody mary, answer the phone, and manage to socialize with her customers. She was the epitome of a good bartender. The food was great, as well. This morning we both had wings and football on the brain and East Blvd is where we wanted to go. It wasn't busy when we walked in, 30 mins prior the game. The bartender didn't even greet us, but merely set a menu in front of us and said, \"What can I get you?\" Sure, I guess everyone isn't as personable as the last...but he just seemed as if everyone was a nuisance and an inconvenience. He acted as if he was swamped, and when we asked for a game on a side tv, he coldly said it would be a bit. At one point, a customer was joking about the phones ringing off the hook, and he fired back \" Would you rather I answer the phone or pour your beer?\" Never cracked a smile, couldn't even muster a \"you're welcome\" following a customer's thank you...I mean, why be a bartender?

We arrived a bit early for our reserved time so we found a nice spot at the bar for a cocktail.  I ordered a house specialty called a \"Crunchy Squirrel.\"  Weird name, strange taste.  Shoulda known better.  The atmosphere is pretty nice on the candle-lit patio, but they have to provide flashlights so you can read the menu. Good thing we showered and changed after the game because it wasn't what I would classify as \"casual\" attire. Most people were dressed in nice date-night attire like us.\n\nBy the time I finished my squirrelly drink, the sweet little hostess had tracked us down to seat us. (She was the friendliest staff person we encountered all  evening.) She gave us what seemed to be a pretty nice, intimate little table, but as the evening grew cooler and a little breezy, it became clear that we were too far from the heaters. \n\nOur server was very professional but not overly friendly. He had to read the specials from a cheat sheet which didn't seem very knowledgeable or enthusiastic. Our food came out relatively quick but to my disappointment, it was only luke warm and I am a stickler about eating my food HOT. Nevertheless, we both enjoyed our small, expensive portions of grilled salmon and lobster.  Presentation was very nice, but as for taste, the entrees were \"okay.\" Not bad, but not mouth-wateringly yummy, either.  Especially for the prices.

He mentioned at least a pound of succulent little morsels of clams over a full pound of linguini. It was our last night in Vegas, and frankly, I was sick of buffets.\n\nWe arrived, and if I hadn't been shown how to find this place I would have never found it, It literally is a hole in the wall. But when you enter the place is a full sized eatery. It's like Bucca De Beppo without the clutter. \n\nOur waiter arrived just seconds after being seated, dressed in black pants and a white shirt, slicked back hair, looking around, all the waiters looked like clones of each other. With him were two carafes of wine, red and white. Then he expertly explained the daily specials, including an eggplant lasagna that sounded amazing. But I had my heart set on this amazing linguini with white clam sauce. John ordered the eggplant lasagna, and I ordered the Linguini, and we said we'd share since the portions were so huge. John also got a meatball.\n\nWe sat a bit talking about our success at the blackjack table and how we were always so close on the Roulette table. I had a good day at the sports book, picking the Steelers over the Browns (duh) and picking the rams and teasing them with Buffalo. So yeah, I was picking up the tab. Not bad wine for being free. Garlic bread was delivered, nice and cheesy, garlic out the wahzoo! Very good indeed.\n\nOur waiter arrived with two HUGE, oversized bowls, one containing my linguini, the other the eggplant lasagna. and two smaller plates for us to share. (no extra charge for sharing!) Can I say I come from a big Italian family, I saw my father eat healthy amounts of pasta at one setting, but I had never seen a bowl of linguini with clams as big as this for one person. I even said to the waiter \"are you sure this is mine and not for a table of four?\" He assured me this was a single serving. I swear it was over a pound of pasta and a pound of clams. Fresh grated Ramono cheese was dusted over the top, and plenty of cracked pepper. He even left the cheese grater and a healthy block of cheese at the table for us to help ourselves.\n\nThe pasta was perfectly al dente, a bit of bite and wonderful flavor from the clams. The clams were very tender, meaty and succulent. John's Eggplant Lasagna was very dense, flavorful, but a bit greasy from frying the eggplant. There was a lot of different cheeses used, I could taste ricotta, Parm, Romano, and a smokey cheese, maybe Provolone? Aside from the grease, it was delicious, rich and tasty. The meatball was very dense, stuffed with all kinds of fresh herbs and garlic. It was easily six ounces.\n\nBattista's is a great place in a great city, after you've had your fill of buffets and quick bites, go have a wonderful sit down meal at an Italian restaurant that does it right.", "business_id": "1bJjWGYip-V2PGj4VIwbiQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-01-26", "type": "review"}

Some even said \"you have to try it before you die\".  I planned by gf's bday party here and the pricing was outrageous.  This place is not meant for large parties, anything over 6 people.  First you have to pay for a fee to reserve either the private dining room or the outside patio; I believe it was between $1500 and $2000.  They have a preset menu which you can pick from but it does not compare to getting smaller plates with a smaller party.  You can try more and get food for what you pay for.\nMy gripe about this place is that the filet was way over cooked.  My entire party of 20 people said the steak was tougher than a polar bear's toe nail.  Also, some of the extra appetizers were very jelloy.  I think this place is worth a try if you're around the Scottsdale area; however, the hype is way over rated and there are plenty of other restaurants that Scottsdale is known for.", "business_id": "yJMLD-6AggZNdC-GonVBsA", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-04-27", "type": "review"}

I went inside with wide eyes and the enthusiasm of a child on Christmas. Something so urban and hip in my little neighborhood of South Scottsdale! Yes, please and thanks in advance.\n\nAfter dining, I am actually a little torn. There was stuff that was absolutely outstanding, and stuff that was just plain not good.\n\nI'll start with the outstanding.\n\nI personally don't really eat pork OR beef, but I figured when in Rome... I ordered the pot roast sammie, and seriously, I thought I was going to pass out from deliciousness. It tasted just like the amazing, tender pot roast that my mom used to make. It was topped with creamy cheese and caramelized onions. I'll be hard pressed to venture out and try anything new because this was just soooo good.\n\nWe also ordered desert after our meal, which if that is all I was reviewing this would be five stars without hesitation. The deserts were creative, delicious, not outrageously sized and are leaving me salivating just thinking about them. \n\nThe beer list was long, and the server was happy to offer recommendations. He was generally a friendly guy and explained the menu well when we had questions.\n\nNow for the just plain not good....\n\nUnfortunately, I have to mirror the sentiments of other reviewers and say that while very friendly, the service was poor. Wait times were long even though the place wasn't packed, and we sat with a table almost completely covered in empty dishes for most of our meal. We almost cleaned off our own table at one point just to have some room, but luckily our server eventually figured it out. I hate to say that because he was very nice, but they missed the mark on some basics of service.\n\nThe tots. I feel like I'm going to be mobbed for saying this, but to me- they weren't good at all. Maybe I was disappointed after assuming I'd get a traditional \"tot\", or maybe the tot of the day wasn't my fave, but I could only manage to eat half of one.  The tot was a \"Philly Cheesesteak\" and to me it was less tot and more fried mashed potato ball with peppers and steak. Not good, unfortunately. I will be totally open to trying them again in the hopes that the flavor of the day just didn't do it for me.\n\nThe cost wasn't outrageous but maybe a little high for the neighborhood. I didn't mind paying it, but some might balk at the prices.\n\nOverall, I will be back, and am looking forward to it. I just know what I'll avoid this time. Hopefully they get their service in check and get their processes streamlined. I have faith in this place, and I hope it inspires other creative, indie eateries to spring up in South Scottsdale.", "business_id": "h_WtRK_umSU8LCCmAeqbFA", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-12-14", "type": "review"}

In almost all casino buffets you feel like you are in a basement but you feel like you are in heaven. \n\nUnfortunately, I am not a big seafood fan. I like my protein from animals and birds. It seemed like every other food selection was made of seafood. I like to start with a big salad with alot of toppings but the salad selection here was joke. The prime rib looked extra rare with blood dripping from the meat, ah no thanks. My favorite was the jambalaya. It was thick and meaty. The sushi sucked. The mushroom ravioli was pretty good. The panang curry was alright. The star of the buffet was king crab legs as it seemed like everyone except us was loading up on the legs. I actually enjoyed their delightful desserts much more than their entrees. They have various creamy dessert concoctions in plastic shot glasses. They were the bomb! The petite chessecake was rich and delicous as well.\n\nOur server was awesome. He took care of us and was attentive. Overall, the ambience and the dessert were the it factors for me.

They did such a great job. I was worried about how it would turn out considering it was a destination wedding.  The communication between our event planner, Dusty, was exceptional.  Every time I wrote her an email or called her she replied or answered within an hour or so.  The food was delicious!  We had our guests choose between the filet, salmon, or chicken and one of my guests (who is a professional chef) said it was the best wedding reception food he had ever had. They were able to set up a projector so we could do a slide show.  They also included a bottle of champagne for my husband and I to enjoy after the event.  The room was a good size for our group (we had 25 guests).  It is too small for dancing or live music, so if that is important to you this place may not work.  We chose to have a luncheon reception at 3pm versus having a dinner for two main reasons.  First off, the luncheon food and beverage minimum is half that of the dinner minimum.  Second, 3pm vegas time is dinner time on the East coast (which is where most of our guests came from).  We were able to customize our menu and select dinner entrees instead of lunch entrees.  Pricing was very fair and accurate.   We were very happy with how everything turned out and I would not hesitate to recommend them as an exceptionally excellent venue for a smaller (less than 30 guests) wedding reception!", "business_id": "4bEjOyTaDG24SY5TxsaUNQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-10-01", "type": "review"}

I was pretty spoiled by having my Chinese friends taking me to the best places in Toronto and doing all the ordering...hence avoiding any kind of communication difficulty. We ended up ordering the juicy pork buns, green onion pancake, hot & sour soup (miscommunication on this one--the bf ordered a small for himself because he was the only one who wanted soup, but they brought out a giant bowl enough for 5-6 people. Oh well), fried rice cake with spicy chilis, crispy stir fried beef, boiled shrimp dumplings and an orange sizzling chicken. Yeah, we ordered waaaay too much for the 4 of us. We have a habit of doing that. Guess I know what I'm having for lunch tomorrow! Anyway, the dumplings were pretty good--ive definitely had better, but these did the job. The pancake was yummy and I like the shrimp dumplings. The fried rice cake dish was different than we've had before---the rice cakes were more tubular as opposed to the flatter oval bias cut type I'm used to. It was pretty tasty, but nothing I'm going to crave. The sizzling chicken was a bit too fatty for my taste, but everyone else loved it. I didn't have the beef dish either (which the waitress had recommended), but my parents really enjoyed it. Aside from the soup size miscommunication we didn't have any problems and the waitress was really good about refilling the waters...which is usually not the case at Chinese places for some reason. The service was very good and they were more than happy to package up the leftovers for us. Would definitely come back again when I need my green onion pancake and soup dumplings fix!

They could accommodate a group of us without a problem, and I can't think of an occasion where the service has been bad.\n\nI am also a huge, HUGE fan of their brunches.  These are easily the cheapest brunches in the city, with no plates over $8, which includes the cost of your bottomless cup of coffee.  They have breakfast pizza, the best breakfast sandwich in Pittsburgh (the sausage eggstasy sandwich, with two sausage patties, scrambled eggs, cheese, and a lovely bun), and something cleverly titled the 'hangover helper,' which has all the breakfast meat you could ask for, plus beer-battered pancakes.  (PS, it's not just for hangovers, it's also enjoyable post-half-marathon, as we discovered this May!)\n\nThe prices at Fuel & Fuddle are so reasonable, even before half-price time starts, and they've stayed pretty much the same since I first started going back in 2001.  They have a great beer selection, if you're into that sort of thing (they even have a beer club where you can attempt to drink 100+ different varieties for a chance at having your name on a little plaque on the wall).\n\nI highly recommend the nachos - this is the thing that brings us back late at night many a time.  They're baked in the brick ovens with real cheese melted right on top, and big chunks of juicy tomatoes strewn throughout.  You can even add chili to the nachos for a little more bite!\n\nOther great menu items include the pizzas (also baked in the brick ovens, and personal-sized, although you may have a piece or two left to take home with you) and the grilled psychedelic, their portabella mushroom sandwich.  The dive diner fries are crispy, perfectly-seasoned waffle fries, and they come on a plate big enough to feed the full party at your table.\n\nSome notes: during the school year (Sept - beginning of May), crowds can be bad at half-price.  If you're over 21, my advice is to get there shortly before (they won't seat anyone for just half-price until 11 itself) and order your drink.  The awesome waitstaff will wait to put your food order in until the clock hits 11, and then you won't be so pressed to find a seat.\n\nThere is a small section of the menu that is not half-price, but it's clearly labeled so you're aware.  \n\nBrunch is 11-2 on Sundays, and on Steeler game days especially, it can get crowded.  We always try to get there just after 11 to get a table.\n\nDownstairs, they have a large seating section that can accommodate groups.  I hosted the NaNoWriMo kick-off party there one year, and they put up with us bringing our laptops while enjoying our brunch.

I had anticipated a normal burger joint with your typical massive American proportions.  I was wrong.\n\nStax is a small place with even smaller dishes.  The burgers are all sliders, and each one costs just as much as a normal sized burger at any other sit down restaurant.  Now, I'm not saying this is terrible for a date where you don't want to show your true colors by scarfing down a 2 pound burger in front of a new girlfriend; however, if you are hungry and want to fill up for under $10-15, it's not going to happen here.\n\nAside from the diminutive proportions, the taste was honestly just not there for me.  It was really pretty marginal and forgettable.  That said, my friend who accompanied me enjoyed his burger, so I am sure some of their items taste great.  I do know that their sweet potato fries are one of these items...they are AWESOME!  Also, their little bar area looked like a cool place to hang out.\n\nSo, there it is.  Go to Stax if you have some cash to let go of and are looking for more of a conversation place than a fill-you-up burger joint.", "business_id": "ObnZiF99lqggVasgyGBtVA", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-05-04", "type": "review"}

I'm from the south and this is my favorite dish. These grits had the consistency of mashed potatoes and were almost gummy. Again, the flavor was very good I just did not like the thick heaviness of the grits. The grilled garlic bread was also just ok. Very little flavor and inconsistent preparation, some was barely warmed, others had char marks. Our waiter was generally attentive but again not very friendly. He also didn't recommend or offer suggestions for anything. The price wasn't bad but honestly have had similar quality for half the price. Due to the size of the restaurant it was also incredibly loud. I don't think we will be back.", "business_id": "Lp-A-JNRUUH72uou5-pMtQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-07-01", "type": "review"}

I had pad Thai for takeout and was pretty decent. Today I had the noodle soup called Thoon - dark broth with chicken and rice noodles topped with cilantro and scallions. Lunch meals come with a small side salad and an egg roll, so that makes lunch filling and a pretty good deal. I was a bit disappointed with the size of the soup. It was small and shallow in comparison to the bowls of other Asian noodle soup establishments. Also felt that they skimped the amount of broth too. I was also expecting a much richer, deeper flavor in the broth.\n\nService is attentive and waitstaff is very pleasant.

I was only expecting five people or so, but she reserved almost 20 some-odd seats!!! So good to know that the Yard House does take reservations in advance for such a huge party.  The party didn't start off as planned since the birthday girl was nearly two hours late for her own party!! lol. However, thank goodness for the large LCD TV screens plastered on every inch and corner of this place, we were able to kill the time, starting with some drinks and enjoying Sunday Night Football at the same time...so it all didn't go to waste :) The beer selection is AMAZING! They dedicate a whole two pages of the menu just for the beer, I've also seen Beer Floats and I have yet to try one. If you don't want to spend full price on alcoholic beverages, they have Happy Hour from 10pm-Close. \n\nThe Yard House...its an interesting restaurant. The ambiance in this place is...well....AMAZING!? ha ha. It's weird, you sit there at your table and the lighting is dim and serene, yet at the same time, with the LCD Screens and the bar smacked right in the middle of the restaurant, it's also like a pub! So...like a high class restaurant/Pub/Sports bar/Lounge? Does this make any sense? Because I'm just typing away and totally going off subject..........\n\nFood! I usually start off with the Calamari, the baby-squid type, not that O-ring type! Yum Yum....and my main dish is always the Crab Crusted Swordfish on Wasabi Mashed Potatoes. Absolutely amazing! The swordfish is cooked just right, every time I have ordered this dish, and not once was the fish over cooked. Its pretty pricey, $23.00 (give or take), but the portion is well worth your money! :) However this time I decided to try something else and a bit lighter. Since i filled my body with a lot of alcohol for the night, something big would get me sick so I decided to order something small. So I figured an appetizer, that's small enough right? I ordered the Ahi Poke Stacker which was $11.95. Ahi Poke is cubed raw tuna tossed in a mix of soy sauce, sesame seed oil, onions, limu, green onions. I grew up on this stuff, so I was quite curious of the Yard House's recipe. I was VERY satisfied. When I received my plate, first layer was ahi poke, then a layer of \"fried something\", next topped with seasoned sauteed Carrots, another layer of  the fried \"crispy something\", topped with more poke. It was light, refreshing, and absolutely delish!!! The taste was just as amazing as its presentation. :) My new favorite dish! Don't forget to finish off with the Kona Coffee Sundae for dessert, it's quite big, so you can share with a friend or significant other! \n\nUsually with big groups, taking orders could be tricky. It makes sense for a group of 14, to assign two waiters to take orders. After that experience, unless the two waiters can communicate good, its not a good idea. Problems such as taking double orders (esp with drinks..) not cool! But it was all squared away with no problems. Other than that the waiters were on their game and totally cool!", "business_id": "j_pce4pG9krrBeYwUni8Pg", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-09-18", "type": "review"}

I always liked everything fine I had at Lang Van for the past several years, but nothing that was absolutely crave-worthy except the cool make-your-own-summer-rolls with shrimp and a pile of fresh herbs they grow themselves. At $17, it better be good. For some reason I really prefer it to Ben Thanh which to me feels dirty and a little greasy.\n\nThe steamer, hot pots and ginger stir frys are fine, but branch out a little more. The pancake is pretty good, but not up to the standards I was used to. But the piece de resistance? Lemongrass Curry Beef. When I tasted it, I felt like I had been waiting for it my whole life (well at least 18 years since the last love affair with lemongrass).  I had previously gotten #100 on the menu which is just plain lemongrass and it wasn't as flavorful as I wanted. The extra little curry in #136 gave it a kick and sweetness that was perfecto!!

On the opposite side of the bar is a huge area for dining.  In fact i think that area is too big.  They should probably reduce the dining area by half to make room for more games. The gaming area was not what i expected it to be.  I mean they had some cool games but i thought the area would be much larger.  The computer gaming room was pretty cool.  My son wanted to play but we didn't get a chance.  It was only $5 an hour to play on the computer. ..next time we go I'll let my kids play in there.  There was a bowling alley in a separate room...we didn't go check it out tho. We didn't eat there this time around so I don't know how the food is. They could do with getting a few more shooter games as those are the kind of games my kids like.  We spent $54 on a play card with 400 credits which was enough for the 3 kids.

While I'm always curious to try much-hyped restaurants, I'm always a bit skeptical--I guess this comes from being afraid that I'll be disappointed.  My dining companion, who'd been here several times with other people, had been wanting to come with me, but I was never able to get a reservation (I've heard you have to reserve weeks ahead, which is testament to just how popular brunch is here).  However, he informed me that he'd always sat at the bar, which doesn't require a reservation, so we decided to try for that.  We arrived at about 11am, and, after about a half hour wait, we were seated.\n\nI was torn over whether to try the bloody Mary bar, which many other reviewers recommended, or a brunchtail, recommended by my dining companion.  Between wanting to save room for food and the cocktail of the day (I forget exactly what it was, but it had rhubarb, which I love), I opted for the hair of the dog, which turned out to be an excellent choice--indeed, so excellent that when the bartender asked if I wanted another, I assented enthusiastically, which I never do, since I try to be conscious of my alcohol intake.  For my entree, I ordered the chicken and waffles, per reviewer recommendations, even though I was a bit skeptical since I don't really care for jalapeno.  I had never tried this dish before, but I've had it since (in Atlanta, no less), so I have a standard for comparison.  While I always hesitate to use this much-cliched word, it was--epic!  The bourbon maple syrup was sweet, but not overly so, and it complemented the savoriness of the waffle (in which I couldn't taste any jalapeno at all) perfectly.  I took the chicken off of the waffle and poured the syrup directly on it in order to ensure that as much of it covered the waffle as possible, and then replaced the chicken.  The chicken was delightfully crispy on the outside and tender and juicy inside--some of the best fried chicken I've had in PGH.  Since I couldn't hope to eat the whole thing in one sitting (it's huge!), I ate the waffle and half the chicken, and took half the chicken home (it was still great the next day!).   After eating the waffle, I felt so full, there was no need for another meal until 5pm.\n\nThe atmosphere is great--very trendy and bright, and there's a DJ spinning tunes on Sun. mornings.  The bartenders, who served us, were attentive and helpful.  While I initially doubted I'd come out saying this, I can confidently say that M&P brunch is worth the hype.

My husband and I went with my mother. Walking up to the space I loved the outdoor patio that no one was seated at. Yes it was over 100 degrees but the sun was starting to go down and a breeze was blowing and the misters were going. We decided to be the first ones on the patio. It was so pretty. \n\nOur waiter comes and takes our drink order. I ordered the fresh fruit margarita, which that days fruit was pink grapefruit, and my husband ordered iced tea. I liked the margarita. It had a good kick to it but not too much alcohol that it knocked me out. It was nice and refreshing with the grapefruit. We also received a basket of chips and salsa. There were two different kinds of salsa and the chip basket looked like there were at least four varieties of chips. I liked the plantain chips the most. Neither of the salsas were spicy which was kind of disappointing. I like spicy salsas. We ordered the guacamole as an appetizer as well and I was also disappointed with this. No spice here either. But it was tasty. I liked the pumpkin seeds with it. For dinner my husband and I both ordered the chile rellano and my mom ordered the vegetarian enchiladas. Our chiles were good. One large chili stuffed with a variety of veggies, roasted with cheese and served with a tomato sauce. I really liked the tomato sauce it was placed on. Very tasty and it had a pretty nice spice to it. I liked that it was different from most chili rellanos and it wasn't coated in eggs and deep fried. A nice change from the ordinary. The enchiladas looked like more of a stacked enchilada with cheese and a variety of veggies. I had a bite of this as well. It was also pretty good. \n\nThe food was a little bit pricey. Without the $40 groupon we had the total came out to be a little over $60. Which seems expensive for what we got. However, I would come back again because the food was really good.

Deal with it or go somewhere else, sheesh. Quit crying already.\n\nYES, Randy's is a favorite hang out for the older crowd. Get over it.

You went there, what does that say about you?\n\nNO, I would not ever recommend Randy's for their tacos, but quite honestly, if you go into a Mom and Pop Diner in Scottsdale and order TACOS (supposedly because you felt \"rushed\" and didn't know what else to order?!?) it is very clearly your own fault. Quit blaming other people for your own shortcomings. Next time, try the Cheeseburger with fries and coleslaw.

Its sad really considering that the food is so delicious. I went in today and ordered the french toast with non-crispy bacon(i order my bacon like this every time i go in and its never a problem). My food came out with extra crispy bacon. I informed the server and she thought I wanted it crispy (not a problem since we all make mistakes). It became a problem when she came back out 30 seconds later with another plate of crispy bacon informing me that the batch of bacon was  just a crispy batch and that all the bacon there was cooked like that. I thought this was ridiculous that she would bring out more crispy bacon since I clearly was not happy with crispy bacon in the first place. I informed her that i come in all the time and ask for my bacon the same way and it has never been a problem before. I then asked her if they could just cook me some bacon that was not crispy. She said she could ask the cook and that it would take a few minutes. I was ok with waiting as I was not in a rush and knew that it ALWAYS takes FOREVER to get food there. About 2 minutes later a man brings out a plate of RAW bacon thats slightly warm. I was really annoyed by this but instead of sending it back a THIRD i just chalked it up as a lost and realized that these people could care less whether I left there as a satisfied customer or not. It really upsets me because I  am a server and i would think that people who work in the service industry would always do there best to make sure people leave happy. I guess I'll just have to learn how to make that delicious french toast myself as I will not be spending anymore of my hard earned money in this establishment.\n\n**Not every experience I've had here has been bad.

Big Daddy and I definitely felt as if we were in a New York or Tokyo restaurant. Sleek, focusing on eclectic faces on chairs with a lovely tree to lighten the space. We went for lunch today but will go in for dinner within a week.  We began with two lovely cocktails- Bill DeGroot did a great job with fresh flavors. I loved my Pineapple Pisco. Big Daddy had first the grapefruit concoction and loved it and second, a Green tree cocktail (sorry don't remember the names). They were light, lovely and fresh. Chef Herb Wilson brings a big city vibe to Scottsdale with this menu. Mexican Asian Fusion sounds challenging at first. We began with Head on Shrimp that were superb in a garlic and jalopeno sauce. I could not go in without ordering that again. Secondly, we had the Kimchi Fried Rice. We have eaten fried race all over the world and this was absolutely delicious. Crispy, slightly spicy, perfectly cooked with nuances. DIVINE. We had two orders- it was that good. We also tried the Mexican Pho  which is a red chile based soup. Delicious and complex, it filled us up. We will be in within the week to sample the dinner menu which looks divine. \"Sparkles'\", the nickname of our well informed server made the meal. She was able to describe the food in very accurate detail and was very concerned with our satisfaction.\n\nAll in all, a superior lunch experience in Scottsdale.

It was served it a very nice fashion. Not only the appetizer but everything else we ordered were served very nicely. My boyfriend and I couldn't decide between their lamb and venison so we decided to order one of each and shared. They were both very delicious. Good meat cooked to perfection as I almost licked my plate. We also decided to try some whisky. We didn't know what to order but our waiter helped us picked the best one they have. We didn't know how to drink it so he taught us how to add little drops of water into the whisky and drink it very slowly. We felt like dummy amateurs when it comes to whisky but our waiter was just so sweet, nice and kind.

I dined here again (finally!), this past Friday, 11/21/14, during light up night downtown. We had 7pm reservations and we arrived early,around 6:40 and were able to be seated promptly, however, they were obviously very busy at that time. The dim sum tray actually came around before our server did so we partook in that first. Glad we did because the tray actually never returned to our table after it's initial visit. We had the pork belly bites (described in my previous review-very tasty). We also chose the corned beef hash brown with russian dressing and an herb salad. There were spicy peppers in the mesculn mix (I think possibly sirano peppers) that gave the dish a nice kick at the end. I think I may have liked the hash brown more than the pork belly bites! Our server came over soon after we chose our dim sum and brought our drinks over quickly. I went with the mai tai-and WOW, I think I was buzzed after simply eating the 151 cherry that was on the end of the straw! It was very nicely made and presented in the tiki glass (pic is up). My boyfriend tried and even he was taken aback at how strong it was. He ordered his creature of habit usual-a beer. We then chose to order off the menu. Of course we ordered the short ribs (actually ended up getting 2 orders of them) but this time, since I had already had the pig face sandwich and he had never been here before, we went with the smoked brisket sandwich. This was my second favorite item (behind the short ribs) that we ordered. Described as smoked brisket, kohlrabi kraut, thousand island sabayon, pickled red onions, horseradish cream, baguette ($11), this was a great take on a reuben sandwich, served with pickled cauliflower and a spicy mustard on the side. I probably could have eaten a whole one myself, it was that good,however, coupled with everything else we ordered, splitting it was fine with me. I hate to end on a less than positive note, but the only disappointing part of the meal was dessert. Maybe I should have thought twice about ordering it considering thta seems to be the common sentiment-dessert here is lacking- however, I wanted something sweet so we chose the salted caramel option. it sounded interesting a sit also included candied beets, however, the salted caramel flavor was lacking and the graham crackers crumbs made the dish far too dry. Of course I'll return to Grit&Grace having had 2 mostly positive experiences there,however, I think it's safe to say, in the future, I will forgo dessert and partake in that elsewhere.", "business_id": "jSqhVWUquT3fGREmNdKdUA", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-11-24", "type": "review"}

The pizza was better than the rest of what I sampled from the menu but unfortunately, the service was horrendous. \nWe went towards the end of a celebration involving beer that the town was having and it was Saturday night so we expected it to be on the busier side. The bar area was loud thanks to an excessively high music volume (I promise I'm not just old and grumpy) and people getting their buzz on. It was a little disorienting and it didn't allow my friends and I to carry on a conversation, but it's not a big deal. It's a college bar/restaurant, after all. The servers, as well as the bartender (who seemed to be serving and talking with the same few people, getting them one drink after another, while neglecting everyone else), were clearly inattentive and probably overworked. It looked to me like everyone had too much on their plates and none of them seemed to be on top of things. They were too laid back (read: spacey) or too exhausted to take on the steady stream of customers coming in after us as well as keeping up with existing customers. Another employee (preferably an alert one) thrown into the mix would have made a world of difference,\nAfter not seeing our server around for awhile, I made the mistake of ordering a beer with the guy who brought us our food. I passed him my ID to take a look at, watched him jot my drink order down, and to my dismay, he was never to be seen again. Wait, I take that back. I was just reminded that we saw him again when he was hanging out and chatting with friends outside. What a coincidence that he was ready to go back inside (in a hurry) just as we made eye contact while leaving the restaurant! When our waitress did eventually come around to see if we were ready for the check, I mentioned my long lost beer and she confessed she hadn't received word of it but was not apologetic, which would have improved the situation for me. It took a bit longer but I received my beer and my check, which of course is a disconcerting combination when I had initially wanted said beer just moments after ordering our food. I drank it quickly in an effort to make our way out of the place in a timely manner but regretted not getting to savor it happily with my meal. Another thing I want to mention (with has absolutely nothing to do with the restaurant's service or the food) is the fact that their water is not purified. This is a non-issue for me in Albuquerque but the tap water in Phoenix tastes remarkably like pond scum to non-Natives such as myself who are well adjusted to better quality water from the tap. I think making an effort to provide customers who are drinking and need to stay hydrated with clean, filtered water free of charge would give businesses an edge in AZ.\n\nOverall, I think this restaurant is being managed poorly but has potential. I wish the employees were a bit more keen on doing their job because I'm sure they're all nice people who I'd like to say sweet things about. I'm not sure if it's a chain, I'm assuming it is, but If they opened one here and it wasn't understaffed, I could potentially frequent it based on the beer selection alone.", "business_id": "MY0_6BAzQCu4sqXqwNEFfg", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-10-09", "type": "review"}

Tuesday September 30th was his birthday and we were all in a great mood looking forward to some excellent food!\n\nI will also state right up front, the food was pretty great, but read on to see why I give it 2 stars...\n\nThe view from the top of the casino is really awesome, and upon first entering the restaurant you are taken aback by the shear size and fantastic aesthetics this place offers. Based on the ambiance, this was going to be good!\n\nThe wine list is incredible, and includes some very unique \"off the beaten path\" greats such as Rob and Sarah Hammelman's SAND RECKONER Malvasia Bianca, 2010, which made the San Francisco Chronicle's Top 100 Wines in the USA a couple years back. The reason that's remarkable is because it's an Arizona Wine, which have traditionally gotten very little \"love\" in local high class eateries.\n\nUpon arrival about 10 minutes early for our reservation at 7pm, we waited nearly 15 minutes to be seated at our table. Once sitting, we were brought water, and waited another 10 minutes before our waiter showed up. \n\nUnfortunately, the (delayed) first impression was further tainted by his breath, which was scorching. I couldn't help but wonder how a person who's job it is to serve food and drink could allow their breath to be that repulsive without noticing. \n\nI didn't get our waiter's name, but he was a middle-aged hispanic man and my first discussion with him was focused on the fact that I (unfortunately) have Celiac Disease. \n\nNot \"gluten-intollerance\", but the real clinically diagnosed version of the disease.\n\nHe ASSURED us up and down that any of the fresh meats, cheeses, vegetables, etc. were gluten-free, and that he would \"personally talk to the Executive Chef\" to make sure my food was properly prepared and didn't contain any gluten ingredients.\n\nLong story short, they brought out the Fondue Platter, which I very much enjoyed dipping my veggies into. At one point, as they were clearing the various appetizers I asked him to leave the fondue cheese because I wanted to use it as a garnish for my rib-eye (which was perfectly cooked and delicious, by the way). \n\nThe waiter, knowing I was Gluten-Free exclaimed cheerfully \"WHY NOT? LOL\".\n\nAbout 10 minutes after eating that cheese (along with some fresh seafood, which was also very good) I started to feel nauseous. \n\nOur waiter had walked over and asked me how everything was, and I said \"fine other than the fact that I feel like I'm going to toss my cookies\".

I told my server it was my first time in 10 years and she immediately said \"nothing has changed.\" Boy, was she right.\n\nThe food is a gloppy greasy gut grenade to begin with... The presentation is straight out of the 80's - huge portions of slop overcooked and swimming in an even more overcooked sea of diarrhea with some wilted iceberg lettuce plopped on top looking sad. It's the most disgusting thing I've ever seen referred to as food. \n\nAll the food here is pre-cooked... meaning it is just sitting there over heat waiting for you to order it. I know this because you can't order anything special, like \"no onions\" in your shredded beef. The chicken was dry and clearly had been sitting on heat for several hours. It was completely vile. \n\nWe had also ordered a cheese crisp with ground beef... that was the description. It said nothing about veggies on it, but there they were - some pathetic overcooked hunks of unidentifiable veg trapped in the tar pit of cheap rubbery cheese and grey meat-esque vomit. It was sickening... \n\nThe decor of this place is a leftover relic clearly designed over 30 years ago by someone who was heavily into psychotropic drugs and Disneyland. That went along with the food which looked like it belonged in a museum (as my girlfriend suggested). The lighting in the room they stuck us in wasn't helping - it cast a blue hue from the skylights onto everything on the table making the food look even less appetizing. Aside from that though, it's kinda kitschy in both a fun way and a pathetic way. \n\nI basically refused to eat anything from the menu (though I tasted some of my girlfriend's dish and the cheese crisp) and stuck to chips and salsa. The chips are the freshest thing sold here and aren't bad. The salsa isn't so bad either. We split a margarita just to sample it and decided it wasn't bad, but you could tell they put cheap tequila in it - beware of subsequent headaches. \n\nIt's a shame the food is so shitty because this place is in a great location.

The though of alcohol was making me sick. Where do we get seated? Right in front of the \"Wine Shelter\"! I just wanted to drink juice...pineapple juice. So, I looked at their drink menu from a tablet.  Alcohol, alcohol and more alcohol. Then I saw \"pineapple juice\" so that's what I got. It was beer brewed with pineapple juice and it was the tastiest beer (Mana Wheat)  I've had this year.\n\nThey had lots of good items on the menu but what I wanted to put to the test were the poutine and porchetta sandwich since I haven't found good versions of these dishes here in Vegas. We got poutine (appetizer portion), lobster roll, chicken sandwich and a porchetta sandwich. You can get your sandwich with fries or onion rings or poutine. \n\nPoutine:\nJust like the good ol' Canadian way of making it: fries, cheese curds and gravy - but this had duck confit which made an already delicious dish even better. The fries were hot and slightly crisp on the outside, fluffy on the inside. The cheese curds are melted somewhere in between those hot fries. The gravy was tasty. The duck confit was tender and perfect on the poutine. This has got to be the best poutine I've had - yup, even better than the ones I've had in Canada. Insane! 5/5\n\nLobster Roll:\nHerbed coleslaw, lobster, butter lettuce on toasted brioche. I've had really good lobster rolls from New England and even here in Vegas - varying price tags too. I've also had awful lobster rolls. This was meaty. However, it has that watery mayo sauce that I'm not too fond of. It's still good but not my favorite. 3.5/5\n\nPorchetta Sandwich:\nPork belly, salsa rossa, garlic aioli and arugula on a baguette. Porchetta is one of those things that makes me feel glad my beliefs don't prevent me from eating pork...if it's done right. This was really fatty and oily...and really delicious. The garlic aioli makes me less guilty for eating porchetta since garlic lowers your blood pressure. 5/5\n\nThe service was on point. Glasses were kept filled.

So here is my honest and fair version after several visits, including the soft opening. \n\nThe design of the space is a little odd.  The first impression is that the space is a little tight.  Reason being there are so many oddly divided areas, like the hidden game area behind the stairs where staffs go in and out of kitchen and a separate dining area on the first floor.  The place is an otherwise well decorated, simple, pub-y kinda joint. The service has always been good, though sometimes I think the wait staffs just aren't that knowledgable about the menu. Bartenders were great and are always on their A game. \n\nBeer selection is decent. Lots of local and domestic microbrews. The other night they had $4 pint on any winter seasonal. I think they have drink specials every time I have been here, so complaining about drink prices isn't warranted. \n\nI haven't been back to the rooftop since the soft opening, which was too dark to eat (or see the other persons face for that matter). I don't know if they have fixed it by now.  Frankly I can't truly enjoy any outdoor patio space in Charlotte ever since it becomes smokers' paradise. I may pop back up there when the weather gets nicer. \n\nFood... It is their weakness.  There are always hits and misses.  I have had the mussels and the onion soup on my first visit.  Mussels were a little overcooked in my opinion. The onion soup has always tasted good but it's a very different consistency (it's a cross between creamy and fluffy... Yes, it has a fluff to it). And it's never hot enough for me as a soup. I have had the banh mi in the late night bite menu, which wasn't a bad deal since it comes with a side.  The meat was a bit overly salty that time, but I may give it another try.  The most recent visit I had the Swedish meatballs. It's a typical tapa size, 3 meatballs with mashed rutabaga.  I found the rutabaga to be fabulous but the meatballs were a little tough in textures.  I think if they can step up the game with the food, it will definitely be a 4 stars place. \n\nI do agree that paid parking isn't cool, but I think that even for uptown. They blocking off an area for themselves is no worse than my city which I pay taxes for telling me I cant park on the street and I must pay to park in private parking lot or garage. At least here we still have plenty of free spaces, just have to walk a little further. \n\nI don't know what beef people have with this management, but I truly believe those personal feelings should not be used as \"reviews.\". This place is no more \"out of character\" than Whiskey Warehouse around the corner. At least I always have good services at the Rabbit, can't say that for WW.", "business_id": "4eWKhiixHQcEvQpwIPvT0g", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-01-21", "type": "review"}

I was stationed in South Korea way back in 2002 and two things I really missed after coming back to the States (specifically Arizona), were Ddeokbokki and Ramyeon.

This place has them on the menu! Now, I didn't try the staple Bulgogi, Bibimbap, or Samgyeopsul, so I can't comment on those. But Ddeokbokki! Seriously!?... Awesome.

I know, I know.. mixing liquor can be dangerous.. but seriously fun! \n\nThe food menu is just as varied.

Although I couldn't speak with my dinner partner, I was close enough to the guest at the table to my left I could tell what brand of soap he used.  After asking to be seated where we could sit closer to each other, we were obliged with only a hint that the request was a nuisance.\n\nOnce we perused the menu, we went on the extensive wine list.  As we were deciding what we wanted, one of the waitstaff arrived with the bread cart and began explaining the options right over my partner and I both being otherwise occupied  looking at and discussing the wine list.  She did not leave.  She did not pardon the interruption.  She just stood there talking and pointing to the bread.  \n\nThere were many courses.  It was all quite interesting and appetizing in the descriptions.  When they showed up, most of them did not please the palate.  I won't go into a description of each course and my thoughts because food is very subjective and much a matter of taste, but I will say I was disappointed in all but the braised veal cheeks, they were incredible and I highly recommend them.  \n\nEven after multiple courses and many items on carts to choose from, I enjoyed a few things, but was just not impressed overall.", "business_id": "wfofFm3AqtyK_ujNQ893mQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-11-08", "type": "review"}

They opened Monday April 5th to big crowds, mainly neighbors clamoring for a new restaurant to walk to especially to watch NCAA tourney finals on all their big screens. The space is a big open warehouse space with a sizeable bar.\n\nNow to the menu: they focus on burgers (duh blondie), but their mantra is fresh and affordable. We spoke with the owners and he put plainly \"If we don't nail a menu item in the next couple days it's off the menu. I only want to have things we excel at.\"  They really thought through all their menu choices such as choosing to only have a 5oz burger to keep it affordable (which to me is on the small side and you need another menu item). Affordable it is- a plain burger is only $4, and most of their specialty ones are $5 and $6 at most. You can add a patty for $1.50. I would prefer a choice to upgrade to a larger 7 or 8oz patty as a jumbo option- they grind their own meat there, so a thicker patty could offer a more rare option, but I get their mantra and in this economy I don't blame them. The beef was a little more lean than I expected it to be. They also offer a \"stuffed\" patty option which has American cheese in the middle. Other menu options include a marinated grilled chicken sandwich (I'll try that next time), some funny salads including a \"Man Salad\", and good wings. I recommend the hot honey BBQ flavor.  Once Pinky's Westside Grill opens across the street I bet they'll have some competition for their good fried pickles. We tried their sweet potato tater tots with cinnamon butter. The owner was undecided if that would remain on the menu. The sweet potato fries are actually waffle fries. Everything on the menu is reasonably priced, so if you want a $12 gourmet burger, go to Liberty. If you want a place you can go in your tattered tshirt to watch the game and not blow a wad of cash, come to the Burger Company. Service was apathetic at best, but hopefully that was opening jitters. The owners seem very open to feedback and were very friendly. I forgot to suggest adding a turkey burger. \n\nEvery day they'll have a $1.50 draft special and they have an extensive martini/cocktail list for a place like that. Wesley Heights will be glad to have a good neighborhood bar now. They have outdoor seating and plan a winter heated patio on the side as well.\nI think they'll do just fine. It's so close to uptown and SouthEnd I think it will work well. \n\nNo website yet, but they are on Facebook and you can find their menu on there.", "business_id": "E_V1MUbhtuaUPtQvGrCIwQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-04-06", "type": "review"}

I love when veggies are in it since it adds a lot more to the texture and flavor. \n\nHere's the kicker that sets them back- they give egg drop soup and 2 fried wontons. I just find it weird that a legit Thai place is serving up like a Chinese takeout. It's an unnecessary part of of the meal that wasn't that good. It just overshadows how good the Thai food is.

Our food was delicious! Brendan also gave my husband and I a FREE and absolutely scrumptious homemade pop-tart: chocolate cherry, so GOOD. I will let my photos speak for themselves.

I ordered the ribs and was not impressed.  They were full of smoky flavor, but they were tough and definitely NOT \"fall off the bone\".  \n\nThe other two times I've had the chance to dine @ Midwood have been much more memorable and have both come within the past month.  In the two most recent times here, I ordered the half rack of the St. Louis style pork ribs ($13), the BBQ Pork Sandwich ($7.50), and the smoked wings ($8).  The ribs the second time around were much better and much more tender.  the BBQ pork sandwich, which I had Saturday, June 3rd, for lunch was nothing short of spectacular.  I asked for the slaw on the sandwich which added a nice, cool, crunchy texture.  The fries were above par as well.  On my most recent trip there, I ordered the wings as well.  The wings were awesome.  As a true wing lover and connoisseur, I have no hesitation in saying these are some of the tastiest, tender wings in Charlotte!\n\nEvery time I've been to Midwood the service has been great.  Every employee I've come in contact with while there, has been friendly, and polite.\n\nI am not sure exactly where Midwood Smokehouse ranks in the pantheon of Charlotte BBQ establishments, but you have to put it somewhere in the top 5; behind Mac's, but waaay ahead of the likes of Old Hickory House.  Something tells me, this place is going to carve out a tradition of great BBQ and friendly service in the heart of the Plaza Midwood for years to come.

Please be mindful of the placard at the entrance of the restaurant.  Hats, cut-off jeans, swim wear, sleeveless shirts, and cell phones are not allowed.  You may be able to get away with the cell phone; the dress code is strictly enforced.  Houston's is a unique restaurant that has a vast client base due to its ambience and food quality.  They respectfully request you to not wear your \"sweat pants\" and find a pair of jeans and polo.  \n\n2.  Houston's has an innovative approach to service.  You do not have one waiter, you have a team of waiters.  This is to ensure your glass is always full an your well take care off.  Do not be offended if you see multiple servers.  As long as your being well taken care off, who cares?\n\nThey have an amazing veggie plate that includes fresh seasonal steamed veggies.

That's mainly because my wife is Japanese (from japan) and I of course lived there for 7 yrs... We've actually only been back in the US for about 2 weeks ... So Japanese food (real) is still fresh on our pallets. \nSo those of you that know me, know that CoCoIchibanya is my absolute #1-2-3-4-5 favorite restaurant of allllllll time. \u9ce5\u304b\u3064\u30ab\u30ec\u30fc\u3001\u30c1\u30fc\u30ba\u3001\u4e8c\u304b\u3089\u304a\u9858\u3044\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002\u3002\u3002\nSo when we found this spot on Yelp, Sakino recommend we try it as she knows I'm missing curry, specifically CoCos.. When in Hawaii, I drag her there. When in LA, I drag her there. When at our home in Okinawa... Well that's home so I can't drag her anywhere lol, but she lets me go like once a week! \nSo of course I'm feeling a little standoffish about this place... Most of our American Japanese dining experiences thus far have been ehhhh.... So in we go.\nRight off the bat, they have that CoCoIchi yellowish colored menu...  Ok. Then I notice something, everyone in this place (staff) is actually Japanese, and speaking Japanese! This please my wife and I a lot... Sounds silly I know but it's kinda rare to have actual Japanese people that speak Japanese in a Japanese restaurant in America. And they were legit, when my wife conversed with them they didn't skip a beat or look lost. Plus 1 pt for these guys! \u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u3059\u3054\u3044\uff01so then I order.. Old faithful. Chicken katsu curry with cheese level 2. Exactly as I would a CoCos... Sakino ordered the same only level 3. \nSo, what I will tell you is this: if you know and love CoCos, this place WILL DO JUST FINE! Is it better? No. Is it pretty much equal? Ehhhh yea sure. Point is for Vegas, this place is basically CoCos, which earns it a 5 star for me... The food is great, the service is great and authentic... Point in case, we come in and Sakino (my wife) sees a young Japanese waitress... She keeps staring and telling me hey hey doesn't she look so familiar? I'm like yea I guess. Sakino was like you know when I was an exchange student at University of Hawaii, I swear that waitress was also a student there on exchange from mainland Japan! I'm like sure I guess but I don't remember babe... So my wife is like ok, after we eat I'll ask her... Well before that even happens, the young girl walks over and is like omg hey remember me from Hawaii etc etc... Turns out it IS Misakichan and she is HERE going to school now... And not only that, today was her first day at this job! What a crazy coincidence that a girl from Okinawa, a girl from mainland Japan, both exchange student to Hawaii, 2yrs later bump into each other at a curry house in Las Vegas? Wtf?! Point is, the people here are great. They are authentic as it gets, and the food is ON POINT! Large for me small for her, 2 drinks, plus tip.. $25 total... Which by the way, is exactly what I'd pay at CoCoIchi.... These guys here at Zen Curry in Vegas are onto something... If the local Air Force guys here that have been stationed at Kadena AFB ever find out.. This place will be packed! \nPlease please please ... Check this place out!

It was apparent that the slightly higher price was worth every penny; the flavour actually tasted natural/real and our option of choosing less than 50% sugar brought out the natural flavours of fresh ginger/taro without being intrusive to the palette. I tasted real taro chunks and the hearty, graininess of the warm plant was truly something unexpected from this small joint in Gay Village.\n\nWe did not order any food there so can't comment on quality in that department.

They have unlimited amounts of crab legs, but unfortunately as much as I like seafood, I have a hard time eating cold crab legs first thing in the morning so I was unable to enjoy that part of the Buffet. \n\nThe unlimited champagne is fabulous! Our server was a quite overworked and they seemed to be short staffed, but we still managed to have about 4 glasses of champagne each which was more than enough. All in all, this is a pretty solid choice for breakfast or brunch while in Vegas, specially if you enjoy champagne or mimosas with your meal. \n\nAlso, there are long lines to get in this place so be prepared for a wait of 30min +.", "business_id": "rBPQuQgTcMtUq5-RYhY2uQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-11-23", "type": "review"}

The rating is based on comparison with other restaurants of its type (the most mass-market example being P.F. Chang).  \n\nWai Wai belongs to a new class of American Chinese restaurants that try to shake off the dingy \"takeout place\" image. The decor has a more modern sensibility to it than, say, Jimmy Tseng's. Think Starbucks meets Asian tea house. The menu, though, looked just like the one from a takeout place twenty years ago. Here you'll find things like pu pu platter and honey chicken. I was disappointed that the entree list was pretty basic. There were only four vegetarian options, and the content of the dish was pretty much just the single ingredient (e.g., a plate of stir-fried eggplant) which makes it look more like a side dish than someone's dinner. \n\nThe food was largely forgettable. The appetizers I tried (fried dumplings, spring roll, crab rangoon) were ok -- though hard to go wrong with deep fried stuff. I was underwhelmed by my main dish (the eggplant). The plate had an island of rice and an island of eggplant surrounded by a sea of brown sauce.  The sauce is overly sweet and goopy, but the eggplant itself had too little seasoning to stand on its own.  The one good thing about the food was that the vegetables were fresh and not overcooked. The string beans were still crunchy and the eggplant still vibrantly purple. The shrimp, however, was probably from frozen.\n\nMy strongest impression of the place might be the clueless waiter we had. As soon as we sat down, he asked for our drink orders, even though we didn't know what they had to offer.  The menu actually doesn't list their drinks, but the waiter didn't volunteer to tell us what they had. To order some tea, it took couple rounds of back and forth with the waiter to settle the matter. When ordering our food, I had some questions about the dishes (like, is the chow mein the thin and crispy kind?).  The waiter's response was \"I don't know, I haven't tried it.\" (Hadn't he served it to other customers? Was he not paying attention?) Upon further interview, it turned out that he had only sampled one dish of this restaurant, and he didn't have anything to say about even that dish.  Even a new hire ought to do better, surely?\n\nBottom line: even for American Chinese food, I've had better. If I should ever be struck by a craving for General Tsao's, I'd probably go take my chances at  Richard Chen or Plum or whatever Asian restaurant standing on that space then.", "business_id": "vGqquKUhtzw3hosrYfxf4A", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-10-10", "type": "review"}

(as agreeable a pair of lunch companions as there are:).\nI had never been to Cuban Flavor, although I am big fan of Cuban food (and cuban cigars, but no,no,no,no, I don't smoke them no more...I've been following Jim W's song title thread:). \nI like Havana Caf\u00e9 (a review for another day), but I had not had some of the \"down home\" or \"en casa\" Cuban food that we got at Sabor Cubano.\nI can take or leave buffets, as general rule (I think \"sneeze guard\" is just a suggestion, in the buffet line, frankly...I have seen far too many people with their head under the Plexiglas, trying to get that last pickle or radish to be comfortable that it keeps much in the way of disease out of the food:). \nFor you non-buffet types, Sabor Cubano has table service, Cuban specials (sandwiches, beef dishes, etc.).\nBut \"danger\" is my middle name and the lunch buffet was truly delightful. \nI got to sample so many cubano dishes that I hadn't tried before. \nThey had navy beans and ham, with giant ham hocks sitting in the beans in the hot table...delightful:) ; they had 3 different types of chicken on the bone, all seasoned and prepared differently and all delicious. There were spicy black beans and red beans, several different kinds of rice, potatoes that really complemented one of the chicken dishes.\nChicken Croquettes, Beef, fish, and vegetables and soup, all cooked in a Cuban style completed the hot offerings. Everything was well prepared, and nothing was dried out and tired (something you see in buffets on a pretty constant basis).\nThe salad bar was clean and the vegetables fresh, and the desert bar had custard and a rice pudding that looked great and authentic (I didn't have desert...I am trying to watch my figure:)\nA very solid offering for under $10, including drinks. It didn't hurt that we had some great conversation and few laughs during lunch, too! \nSabor Cubano stays in the rotation:)\nBrian and Mr. K, thanks again for pointing me south to Cuba!

Much to our surprise, their version of complimentary salsa/chips was actually a basket of crusty French bread and tapenade.   Perhaps the chef's way of quietly letting you know that this meal is not going to be what you were expecting.   And the margaritas they make here are the real deal....no cheap sugary mixes; just perfectly balanced fresh, high quality ingredients...  not overly strong nor watered down.  Thankfully, the 45 minute wait ended up only being about 25 minutes, and we were quickly ushered out of the cold.  Why does it have to be so cold when I visit Phoenix?\n\nOnce we got inside, we immediately ordered more drinks and an appetizer.  The guacamole was prepared for us by our server table-side.  Nice touch with the pomegranate seeds, and I was delighted to see the chips were homemade.  It was so good that we quietly fought each other over it.   And by the way, our server was the rare type that you do not see much today:  very professional and efficient without the fake friendliness we all despise.      \n\nNormally, I detest live music in a restaurant, but I found myself really enjoying  the two musicians who were playing this night.    The singer's tenor voice had a really nice timbre to it, and the music was entertaining without being obtrusive.    \n\nWe ended up ordering two of the three things our server recommended, and he definitely steered us in the right direction. \n\nI love mole and have trouble passing it by when I see it on a menu, but this version was absolutely mind blowing.   Mole Negro is a pretty scary looking dish, but at least they tried to make it look presentable with some thoughtful garnishes.  Nothing greatly original about topping the black sauce with sesame seeds and red onions, but you would be surprised how many restaurants skip this much needed step.    Very large portions with about 5 or 6 individual enchiladas  and a generous side of grilled zucchini.    \n\nI sampled the Enchiladas del Mar and immediately got jealous I had not ordered this. I love goat cheese and these are loaded.  Why don't more Mexican restaurants dabble with this type of cheese?     I think it has something to do with cost, of course.  This place may be a tad expensive but stop complaining:  you get what you pay for and this place is worth every penny.  And I can say that especially since I was being treated by my sister and husband for my birthday.\n\nThe Enchilada de Suiza looked very cheesy, but unlike the crappy topping you find on most everything in Tex-Mex joints, this was actually very tasty with good texture.    This is Mexico's version of comfort food.  \n\nWe ended the evening with Crepes with goat's milk caramel.  Another great recommendation from our server.    This desert could easily be my last meal.\n\nI guess it wasn't until the end of the meal when I finally looked up and started noticing all the great original artwork on the wall.   Wow, every aspect of this restaurant is truly first class.", "business_id": "1NZLxU5WvB5roPFzneAlLw", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-03-14", "type": "review"}

Vegas is supposed to have the best food but when it comes to buffets, it seems the pricier the more dissappointment there is. But not when it comes to Wicked Spoon.\n\nThis buffet was great for two reasons. Variety and taste. B/c of the variety in choices in terms of taste buds and price, this is probably the easiest buffet to eat more than your moneys worth.\n\nSeafood: im indifferent about crab legs so if you need to have them, dont come at lunch. Im glad the seafood isnt only shrimp cocktail and crab legs like at other places. What i saw and remember: bowl of steamed mussels, GOOD sushi, shrimp cocktail, smoked salmon. \n\nLets calculate. Steamed mussels are usually $7 as as appetizer. Eat 4 of the salmon nigri. And youve already eaten $17 worth before touching anything else.\n\nAs far as sushi, they had other items that looked better than the sushi at any othee buffet but the nigiri is the only thing of restaurant quality.\n\nOther items I remember...\nGnocci (wrongly shaped, they were ball shaped and not very good.\nPapparadelle pasta, omelette station, fruit (grapefruit, whole peaches and plums, grapes), spareribs (bf loved those. He ate a whole plate of them), steamed pork bun with pickled veggies. The bun was the kind they use to wrap peking duck, sausage patties, full sized pancakes, oatmeal, fried chicken, mac n cheese, their housemade sausage.\nDesserts: original ice cream flavors (thai tea, caramel candy bar, mango passion, coffee with white chocolate crispies, and more), pastries, macarons, housemade marshmallow, fudge, carrot cake, strawberry shortcake, tiramisu, pecan tart.\n\nThings to note: the thai tea and mango passion ice cream were incredible. It tasted just like thai ice tea and the mango tasted like a real mango but in ice cream form. \nMacaron filling was some kind of jam. I wasnt into it. Probably the worst macaron ive ever had. \nHousemade marshmallow is enjoyable. Its not overly sweet.\n\nAnyways. Loved the variety in choices! Loved that it wasnt just crab legs, prime rib or the same stuff you see at other las vegas buffets.\n\nI will definitely be coming back.

Besides general bar-fare, they offer some of the best weekly dish specials a bar can conjure up.

The most memorable dish from here was actually a Basa filet in mushroom gravy and perfectly grilled veggies along with mashed potatoes. That, my friends, is NOT traditional bar-fare. The chef they have locked up (love that comment Joe S.) does a stellar job. Please don't forget they offer all the traditional fried food options you can dream up.

The barkeeps keep regulars happy with free-flowing drinks and will make your day as well if you stop in! They offer a full bar along with beers of different variety as well as select wines to be pared with your special dishes if you purchase one. \n\n~Atmosphere/Service~\nOnce again, service is superb every time I go. I am by no means a regular, but they treat you like one. I feel at home here when I come in to have a bite or shoot some pool. There is no real dive atmosphere, its truly an interesting mix. The inside is by no means \"nice\", its a bit older and adds to the general feel of the room. Along with the bar area with the regulars and the OTB on the screens with rooting betters, it surely is an interesting collection of atmospheres in one.

(He was very nice, by the way) Oh my goodness, boy, we should've gone with our gut instinct.\nOur dinner included...\nFoie Gras (excuse my spelling): Buttered toast with Foie Gras and Pear Chutney and fleur de sal (salt) and peppercorns. Together, it was so delicious, the pear chutney was a little sweet on its own, however, in the mix it was delicious. The dish began to get a little salty towards, the end, so just ease up on the salt, and it was super rich and the liver was really rich, so delicious. My favorite dish!\nLobster Angel Hair: The angel hair was cooked perfectly, and the cream sauce was a little too rich, especially with the huge hunks of lobster it was served with.\nVeal: So perfectly cooked, it was really tender, and just slightly pink. The sauce was really fatty and rich, and it was served with slow cooked pearl onions, baby lettuce, and mushrooms... I skipped out on them because I was so incredibly stuffed. (I actually ate the slow cooked baby lettuce, it was really flavorful but super mushy)\nEggnog: With nutmeg, and Grand Marnier. This was such a delicious creamy delight, however, the drink was supposed to be a palette cleanser....for freaking Santa Claus. This was another rich dish.\nLastlyy!! \nBush de Noel: This wasn't your traditional one, this was a citrus themed one with vanilla bean ice cream, soaked sponge cake and orange sorbet. So delicious, but the cream exterior was wayy too sweet and sgary and the sorbet wasn't creamy, it was a little bitter.\n\n Long review for a delicious dinner, however the entire meal was terribly terribly rich, and I wish that it had a few palette cleansers and some more texture.\nLet's just say I don't need to eat heavy food for a month after this...", "business_id": "Pz7SWZQhxL6ZbhL9jE2NTA", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-12-26", "type": "review"}

We just got out of the movies and were looking for a place to eat. I remembered buying a Groupon for Agave, so we headed over. When we arrived it was 9:50pm (10 min to happy hour), so we took our time perusing through the menu and ended up ordering Fresh Fish Tacos, \nCrispy Fried Machaca Beef Burrito, and two margaritas at happy hour price ($5 ea). \nEven though it was happy hour, the place was really empty, but I actually prefer it that way. The ambiance is so beautiful at night. All the warm colors and small dangling lights just made me feel like I was having dinner under the stars. \n\nWe got complimentary chips with three different salsas. I'm not sure of the names so I'll just call them bright red, dark red, and green. My favorite was the dark red salsa. It was mild and had a fire roasted taste to it. The chips were fresh and crispy, just how I like them. Sometimes when I go to a Mexican restaurant that gives complimentary chips, they're stale or undercooked, but that wasn't a problem here. The fish tacos had a poblano pepper slaw inside that Don really enjoyed. They also came with rice and beans. The only thing he didn't like about them was that they came on flour tortillas instead of corn. The Crispy Fried Machaca Burrito was huge! Look at this beast: http://s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/UtxbOEWhfmNajcmfRZuMLQ/l.jpg. Even though I was practically starving, I still couldn't finish more than half. It was delicious though. It had shredded-dried beef with fresh avocado, Mexican rice, refried black beans topped with red fresno sauce and melted Mexican cheeses. If you've read any of my past reviews, you know I love avocado and rice in my burritos. The black beans instead of pinto beans were an added bonus. This was actually the first time I've had a crispy fried burrito and I really enjoyed the crispy outer layer. I felt weird eating a burrito with a knife and fork, but seriously, it was smothered in red sauce. I would look like a monster eating a baby if I just picked it up with my hands. \n\nAll in all,I still love Agave. Last time I went was at 11am when they just opened, so there was nobody there, which made for a peaceful breakfast. This time I went at 10pm in the middle of the week and there wasn't anyone else there, so it made for an intimate date.

Not that big of a deal. \n\nWe were seated right away. I liked that they had big booths and the picnic tables were fun. \n\nOur waitress couldn't have cared less that we were there. We even told her it was our first time there and she didn't even welcome us or tell us anything about the place. \nWe ordered the ballpark pretzel to start. I wasn't impressed with it at all. Its more bread like, very fluffy, not like a ballpark pretzel in the slightest. The cheese dipping sauce that came with it was underwhelming. Total bum out.\n\nOur meals came pretty quickly. I ordered the Chinese chicken salad, it was good. I liked the dressing and the fact that it was shaved chicken. I really liked the tortilla strips in it (though that's more like for a taco salad?) Overall it was a decent salad, they could use better quality lettuce in it, it seemed to be mostly iceberg. \n\nMy husband got the prime dip with a side of onion rings. He said the sandwich was just ok, not terrible but not memorable either. The onion rings were a joke. They had zero taste and honestly tasted like the onion rings that you buy in the freezer section of the grocery store. We each ate one and then he took the rings off his plate and set them off to the side. No one wanted to eat them. I actually asked the waitress if the onion rings were made FRESH, she said yes, I said really because they taste like they came out of the freezer, she said, welllll ummmmm ya I think they are frozen. NOT cool to lie to customers. \n\nMy mother in law got the fish and chips. The fish was actually pretty decent, I stole a bite. However, once again frozen run of the mil french fries and the coleslaw was not edible. \n\nWhen the bill came I noticed they charged us $1 for the horrible onion rings. I told my husband and when the waitress came back he asked her why. As I had said previously, we had told her it was our first time, when she asked him what side he wanted he said he didn't know what they were so she listed them off for him and did not tell us that the onion rings were a \"premium\" side dish and were extra. Seriously it is only a $1 and we wouldn't have even made a deal out of it if they would have actually been edible. So we asked her if she could take the $1 off as they were terrible and we didnt eat them and we weren't even told they were extra. She sends the manager over, seriously. To take a $1 off. He told us he could take the $1 off or give us a free dessert. We went with the $1 off as we were all ready to get out of this place. He didnt even ask why.\n\nSo there you have it. Its a cool looking place, looks like they have a nice patio. The food is underwhelming. For 3 dinners, 2 beers and an app our bill was about $64. \n\nWould I go back here on my own?

I mean, this is a FRENCH place, right? The French can certain cook up a mean dessert, and BLT Steak delivered in this arena. I ordered a Crepe Souffle with a Passion Fruit Sauce and it was SCRUMPTIOUS! Very, very light yet flavorful. The outside was clearly \"torched\" so that the sugars carmelized ala creme brulee. But that passion fruit sauce was to die for! If you're wanting a dessert that 1) won't break the bank and 2) is light yet delicious, get this one!\n\nThe 2 bartenders (Ashely and Nicole - sisters!) were awesome! Very attentive, friendly and knowledgeable. My only knock on the place was the the wines were VERY EXPENSIVE! Do NOT come here expecting a bargain! The average price of wine was about $15/glass! The Priorat Spanish wine I ordered was superb so that deadened the pain somewhat. But 2 glasses set me back $32!!! The BOTTLE's retail price is around $30 so THAT is some expensive bar wine! But again thankfully, the pours were generous and the wine quality was superb so I was OK with it overall.\n\nMy friend said she's been here for dinner and that it was awesome. In looking at the prices it better be! For example, a 22oz Bone In Ribeye was $52. I'd pay that IF AND ONLY IF the quality was at least PRIME, and the flavors were sublime. These are NY, Vegas and LA prices. Worth it IF it's really THAT good. I will let you all know.\n\nThis restaurant is right next to Bar Chocolate, which had some very YUMMY looking desserts.

Okay, well for starters I almost gave up since the sign outside still says Kabuki and not Sakana!  I was actually already going to take one star off for the fact I drove around and around...until I read a little yelp tip that finally led me to this treasure.  When we walked in we were immediately greeted and asked if we wanted a table or sushi bar....I said table, but the sushi bar chef yelled sushi bar at the hostess and apparently he calls the shots =P  Eating at the sushi bar was definitely an advantage, we called off our orders to the chef and he made them on the spot! \n\nFor starters this place has AYCE for $22.95...cheapest AYCE in Vegas that I know of.  So most important part of AYCE is freshness and the rice to fish ratio for the sushi.  I swear there were not more than 20 kernels of rice per piece of fish!  I would equate this to almost eating sashimi with the small amount of rice per piece.  The salmon, white tuna, unagi, seared tuna were all extremely fresh and well prepared.  Okay, so the best part is how they sear off the tuna and unagi with a blow torch....it was still piping hot when I consumed it, pure heaven! The specials that day were salmon belly and toro steak....again more bites of perfection!  We tried a few rolls that were on their dinner/one time only part of the AYCE menu as well.  The towering sashimi poke with wonton crisps...I could have just sat there and eaten that all night, cripsy wonton shell with fresh fish and a touch of acidity....too bad we were limited to one order per person =(.  We also tried their Screaming O and the Sashimi Roll, both of which were well prepared as well.  The only thing I honestly did not like....the plum ice cream (this was slightly atrocious to be since it reminded me of the pink amoxicillin (antibiotic) medication I had as a child that they tried to disguise with some unknown flavor.  But, minor flaw given they have plenty of other options for dessert.  Make sure you look at their updated menus on the counter as well....the one that is laminated that they hand you is missing a few items.  If you love AYCE sushi....you have to try this place out.

So one of my friends recommended this AYCE sushi place to me in Vegas. At first I was extremely skeptical, considering the closest ocean to Vegas is about 6 or 7 hours away.

My only gripe is the sushi isn't the most fresh and most of the rolls are hit or miss, but the selection makes up for it.

A rather small, store front like ristorante of the type one finds in Chicago or New York with excellent food and a superb selection of wines. An excellent bar is the centerpiece to seating for about 35.  Now they had no cocktail onions and no drambuie, but beyond those faux pas, we had an excellent dinner.  We had a wonderful server named Sara who knew the menu intimately, had superb wine pairing suggestions by the glass or bottle and she recited the specials off the chalk board with the expertise of the professional she is and clearly provides the establishment with an exceptional talent.  She had tried most of the menu and was an entrusted expert when it came to deciding between items.  I would return only if she were my server. They had no cocktail onions for my Gibson, but the olives transformed my norm into a superb martini of acceptable character and overcame my temporary disappointment.  We did several of antipasto as starters and had a wide array of sausages and terrines that were excellent, along with a fresh seafood plate that featured sushi grade ahi tuna done several ways and calamari in a provencal sauce that was a perfect pairing with the home made breads. I would have like to have seen some oil or butter on the table to accompany the breads.  Home cooked, properly prepared and served, they were excellent when paired with our entrees at this dinner.  This anitpasto was such that one could enjoy wine, bread and antipasto and forgo dinner. The squab and foie gras was excellent, perfectly cooked, though a little shy on the foie gras, it was an excellent entree served on a bed of sweet and sour greens and off the menu.  The others in the party had pasta, all homemade and tasty with obviously hand cut sausages and special attention to the sauces and toppings of fresh veg and cheeses. The crepes were seasoned well, stuffed properly and tasty in a light bechamel sauce..  For dessert we tried the ricotta cake - moist and a fun topping of fresh berries, the butterscotch pudding - melts in your mouth better than anything grandmother ever made and perfectly brewed coffee in a French press to culminate an excellent meal.  Not as pricey as some might think, well worth it for exquisite fare.  Service was superb, food excellent, hot and well presented in unque presentations.

We did the $145 domestic wagyu \"tasting\". My issue was that for 2 people, it was more of an apps, sides, and desserts tasting over a steak tasting. The amount of apps, sides, and desserts was absurd and kinda took away from the steak experience for me (and it looks like the tasting portion of steak is smaller than the a la carte portion). I struggled hard to finish my steak and left so full I couldn't see straight. Might be better for a larger group.\n\nNonetheless, I tried various delicious things and here's my recap:\n- rolls- salty and fresh! Leftovers were great the next day too :)\n-Lobster bisque- big ass chunks of lobster and lots of good flavor, a little too rich to precede a steak dinner though in my opinion.\n-Persian cucumber salad- light, refreshing, crisp\n-Fris\u00e9e- with the runny egg and Gorgonzola it gets a nice creamy texture. Lardons on point.\n- wagyu tartare- not the best I ever had but still enjoyable\n- wagyu skirt steak- one on the most memorable steaks I ever had! Got it medium rare and loved every second of it\n- wagyu rib eye- found this to be a let down, it was tough and would have preferred the angus over the Kobe if I did it again. \n- Yukon mashed potatoes- best I ever had\n- mushroom medley- loved it\n- broccoli rabe- I usually hate it, but it's well salted and garlicky so, done very well!\n- mango cheesecake- my dessert fave!\n- sticky pecan bun- very tasty but too big and decadent for my taste. I had 2 nice bites. If I finished the whole thing I would have exploded. Good for sharing.\n- fruit- whatever it's fruit. Good but had it not come with the tasting I wouldn't order\n- sorbet- good and light\n\nSo as you can see, loads of food and you def get your money's worth. The skirt steak wagyu was the winner with potatoes taking the silver.\nIf I could do it again, I would order one of the above salads, skirt steak wagyu, mashed potatoes, mushrooms, and mango cheesecake or the sticky bun :)\n\nService was perfect and the steak knives were weird.", "business_id": "HbUQ_3dlm3uCacmhTEMnuA", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-11-02", "type": "review"}

There were several open tables, however, the hostess told us that it would be a 90 minute wait to seat the two of us. When we asked about the open tables, she informed us that they were low on wait staff...on a Saturday night...during March Madness.

It's much nicer than people are describing on here. I like to refer to it as asia-chic. IT's not traditional, but it's definitely japanese inspired. also, the pictures of anime on the wall are much more than some posters. they are high quality canvas print panels, and they also have j-pop playing in the background, with gundam anime on the two flatscreen TVs. The cute waitresses in colored wigs and fun outfits greet you in japanese, much like they do in japan (they do this for everyone who comes in, no matter what they happen to be doing at the time. It's really fun. they also thank you as you leave in the same manner.)\n\nI ordered the tom-yum ramen, some hot tea, and honey toast.

It was everything i love about ramen- greasy, delicious slurpable noodles, chicken chunks, and a spicy broth that really helped with my cold. Plus, the serving portion was huge.

The Barby, another pork BBQ sandwich, is pretty amazing, too. Who doesn't love all of these flavors... with bacon?!\n\nI also love the caprese slider (also listed as a special).

The main dining room has a great vibe, and it's fun to watch Giada visiting tables and happily posing for photographs with fans. \n\nThe experience is perfect except for a couple of things;\n\nFirst, and most significant, are the \"pours\" from the bar. Cocktails are heavy on solids such as ice or olives but very light on fluids. And wine by the glass comes in the smallest pours I've ever seen at an upscale restaurant. For the prices the volume of liquor/wine in the drinks should be much more generous.\n\nSecond is the seating. It seems the hostesses are adhering to old-school tactics in that if you want a decent table you need to tip them. Otherwise you may very well get seated in the Siberia of tiny, cramped back alcove that's away from the fun atmosphere of the main dining room. Not sure if Giada is aware of this practice...hope not.\n\nThe restaurant is packing in fans of the show, but to be successful in the long term it needs to develop a core base of regulars. To do that they really need to improve on the bar, as that's a problem. \n\nOverall a great new addition to the Vegas restaurant scene and, bar aside, right up there with our other favorites!", "business_id": "s5-VDvUqyYnD8RG3LPqnbQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-06-26", "type": "review"}

They would contact my friend who personally spoke to someone \"soon\" to go over the details. It took somebody a couple weeks to get back to her, but when they did they did inform her we would in fact have to get the \"minimum\" bottle service. Honestly, it really wasn't that big a deal. Like I said, there was 14 of us, and the minimum bottle service was $200 (we got Grey Goose), plus they would throw in a round of shots. \n\nWe got the table for 10 o'clock. However, when we showed up we were told we didn't have it until 10:45.

That being said, it's usually about $40 each when I have dined at Terrace Point, but we have a few drinks, appetizers, dinner.. it's all good and not too much more than I would spend at any other cafe around Vegas. \n\nTh atmosphere is relaxed with comfortable seating and they have good food and a full bar. For that I'm In! Check it out!", "business_id": "vaq5SJubaZjIoGhgkwxxUA", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-04-24", "type": "review"}

The wait staff was friendly and efficient. We ordered some raw oysters on the half shell that were very tasty. The fried oysters were also tasty. They were fresh, so not fishy,but still rich. Yum! Not cheap, but at least good. \n\nThe lobster bisque got mixed reviews from our table. I thought mine was okay, but the rest of our group thought it was quite salty and inedible. So, either my taste buds were having an off night, or I was so happy with the oysters that I was still on a seafood high. Not sure, but we did send back one of the bowls and they took it off the tab.  The rest of the food was not too memorable. \n\nI'd eat there again for the oysters, but not sure about the other stuff. \n\nIf you like oysters, give this place a try.", "business_id": "SSbId_gHGjtXWnObc_S0nw", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-03-24", "type": "review"}

Very interesting decorations, good music (not too loud), and comfortable seats. \n\nSecond, the food was fantastic. We had: Chicken Croquettes, Fois Gras Cotton Candy, Tuna Tartar, Jose's Tacos, Oysters, Brussel sprouts, Veal Chop, Skirt Steak, Delmonico potatoes, and Robuchon potatoes. If it sounds like a lot of food, thats because it was. But everything was amazing. I left the restaurant full and happy. The skirt steak was the most tender steak I have ever eaten.\n\nThird (and probably most important); the service. The service was incredible. Our server Tony has a passion for what he does, and it shows. I have been to great restaurants that I hated because the service was terrible or the server was grumpy. In a nice restaurant, service can make or break the experience, and in this case, the service definitely MADE the experience. The manager Hien was fantastic. He repeatedly checked on us to make sure everything was to our liking. You can see the employees here pay attention to the details, which makes this place well worth every penny spent. \n\nI highly recommend!", "business_id": "GjQbbMwu8OzictyBdgYY5g", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-10-06", "type": "review"}
