Not only is the owner, Gus, a pleasant guy to do business with; he will have you laughing at his general demeanor every visit. On my second visit he recognized my face and instantly made me feel welcome. Not only is Gus very hospitable, the rest of the staff follows suit (horrible pun intended). You know the other tailors you go to that know you by ticket number? STOP GOING THERE! Brothers will make you feel like you're their only customer and will have you walking away feeling like a million bucks every time. I'll admit, I went into the store based on a friend's suggestion and when I first walked in, judging by the size of the place, I thought my friend had played a joke on me. Do not be fooled by its appearance. Brother's is the real deal. In terms of selection they have everyone covered. You can walk in and get a $150 suit off the rack, which they'll tailor to your specifications at an insanely low price. Or you can walk in and completely customize a bespoke power suit. If you don't really know what you want or you're buying your first suit, for example, Gus or the other staff members will work with you for as long as it takes to get it right. When I went in for a custom suit, Gus took no less than two hours catering to my every request. Is that something you'll get at Men's Warehouse? The answer is no. To be honest, I will never step foot in another tailor's shop. There's a reason why this establishment has a 5 star rating.  I've been 4 times and Gus and his staff have already made me feel like family. This is the way small business is done. \n\n      Yes, Gus calls every guy that walks in the store a model. Yes, when you come in for one suit he'll ask whether you want 6 or 7. However, the bottom line is that Brothers will give you the best customer service, they'll make sure you get exactly what you want, and they'll do it all for the best price in town.", "business_id": "PJplFEJ8ltTIfbabNrYqOQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-01-23", "type": "review"}

A employee was in the way the whole time stalking them, only strawberries and blueberries. I guess Walmart doesn't carry blackberries? Weird. The blueberries only came in huge packets full which I definitely didn't need and was pretty pissed the didn't have small packages of blueberries. I got strawberries which came in a small (regular) sized packaging but after inspecting my first package I saw they had mold on them which is nasty and gross Walmart would be selling them.

Not knowing too much about bikes at the time, i inquired about a basic \"once over\" on my bike.  Matt said he'd do a full tune-up for $45.  Every other bike shop quoted at least $80 for the same service.  Sure they offer tune-ups in the $40 price range, but it is just basically adjusting the derailers and brakes and a whole lot of \"checking\" things.  He did all that plus changed the cables and and housing and cleaned things up.  The tire also had a flat and, since he could not fix it, he replaced the tube at 25% off.  I got a new chain for the same price as the big internet sites and he slapped it on for free too.  Check with other bike shops, go ahead, it's at least a $10 service.  In fact, every new component I've bought from Matt came with free installation, this includes tubes and a freewheel.  The guy i bought the bike from had swapped out the original 8 speed freewheel for a 7 speed so I had this phantom shift which was very annoying.  He did not have a new 8 speed in stock but he ordered one for me.  In the meantime he adjusted my shifting so that it essentially eliminated the 8th gear and, bam, no more ghost shift!  This was free, by the way, and it was all at closing time.  He's there to help.\n\nI've got a new bike multi-tool, cycling shorts, chain lube, toe clips, seat bag and other accessories at fair prices, all new too.  As far as used items, he gave me a great deal on a Camelbak and instructed me on the proper way to clean and sanitizeit.  Much better than spending $60 plus on a new one.\n\nSeriously, the guy is not in the business of nickel and diming you to death.  Cycling is already expensive enough without being charged for every little thing.  Check the other LBS's around.  They charge $5 for a grip installation.  Are you kidding me??  That's like somebody charging you $5 to toast your Pop Tart for you.  Look, it's a consignment store that sells a wide array of products for everything outdoor.  It is not a true bike shop given the fact that he does not sell new bikes so don't go there looking for a 2014 Fuji or anything like that, but that was not his intention.  But he does offer outstanding service and he'll answer as many questions as you can ask.  I know he has for me.  He is a tried and true bike mechanic and I don't see myself going to anybody else to look after my bike.\n\nIf you want to get into anything from cycling to camping, he'll help you do it as inexpensive as possible without sacrificing service or knowledge.  Try him before you go anywhere else first.  You'll be happy you did.", "business_id": "LH-RvU4CoJIana0ZKbX88Q", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-02-10", "type": "review"}

Let me tell you why.\n\nLet me first inform you about Hermes.  It is different from the LVMH conglomerate which owns Louis Vuitton, Moet & Chandon, etc.  Although those stores take exhaustive measures to ensure quality in their products, Hermes specifically is known for their leather goods (Louis Vuitton was first a luggage/chest manufacturer).  Hermes has all been about leather goods- from when they were first catering to high-end equestrian hobbyists.\n\nWith that said, yes; their leather goods are unparalleled.  \n\nThe best things in life are free.  The next best things are very, very expensive.  Thus, Hermes.\n\nBut this store in particular is a big no no.  Sales associates should be helpful to whomever.  However, they were not helpful to me at all.  And no, I wasn't in shorts and t-shirt (regardless, they shouldn't judge), and I wore something decently presentable.  They discriminate relentlessly and act like they have no time for you.  This is a horrible, horrible mistake many people make in luxury retail.  Gucci does not do this.  Louis Vuitton does not do this.\n\nI was going to get an Hermes tie for a friend and as I was asking about prints, but the person helping me was just looking away as he was talking.  I'd have to grab his attention if I wanted to ask him something.  There was no one else in the store and he was just waddling around aimlessly around- at least stay nearby so you can make a sale.  But no.\n\nIf you want to go to an Hermes store and be treated right, go to the one at Crystals, at City Center.  I bought from them a year ago and they were very helpful and receiving.\n\nDo not go here.", "business_id": "qBFS8GHlEK7ouwyBuQjF_A", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-01-03", "type": "review"}

The downfall is that if it's windy outside or if there are a lot of people you might have to sit in the sun or you cannot see what is going on. Since it's a kid activity, smaller kids might not be able to see since the older kids are standing. I would probably suggest getting there early and getting a seat up front if you if have a wee little one. They use a mic for the sound so the sound is not a problem at all. Bring your blanket or something comfy to sit on! \n\n\nTown square as a whole is cool...although I try and avoid this place during the hot heat temperatures. They do have misters in a few areas but an outdoor shopping area in the vegas heat is not my kind of fun.

I think their man cave has an open door to bring in fresh air from outside.  \n\nThey have a great selection of watches, lighters, and cutters.  I can guarantee no one has their selection.

Actually, my experience with these stores is that they can vary greatly in terms of maintanance. This location is always well-stocked and clean. Even the restrooms are well taken care of, without the wet paper mess that seems to plague other discount store restrooms.\n\nShopping at a warehouse store is always better if you plan ahead. It's never good to just impulse buy. That 24-pack of paper towel rolls or 50-pound drum of vitamin C tablets might not be less expensive than your local grocer if you work it out. And this location in particular is a madhouse on Sundays, with lots of families allowing their kids to run around sampling dishes in the frozen foods section and clogging up the parking lots with their behemoth SUVs. Go on a weekday, early in the day if possible. It's a totally different experience.\n\nCostco does tend to consistently stock the same range of items, but they are constantly adding things as they become available or as the demand grows. Recently they seem to be working to include more organic options, and I love that they stock soy milk as well as traditional dairy. This past week I found Dunkin' Donuts coffee, a new item. Looked like a 10-pound bag. Might be perfect for anyone who just can't get enough.\n\nOne extra note - this location also offeres an independent optometrist and optometry department. It may seem odd to go for an eye exam at the same warehouse store where you can buy tires and bulk crackers, but when my granny reloacted here a couple of years ago this is where she went and they took excellent care of her.", "business_id": "_7cs3oVau0UzryykHf3ahQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-02-20", "type": "review"}

Purchased a new power sectional from the Cheyenne/Rainbow location back in November of last year. I believe it was a display item from the Market. Initially we noticed that some led lights on it wouldn't turn off, so the salesperson insisted we delay delivery an extra week so it could be fixed. I also had them check the recliners to make sure they all worked, and they did. So we waited an extra week (so 10+ days total) and when it arrived, the led lights still wouldn't turn off... and one of the power recliners wouldn't work. I  was pretty disappointed that I had waited that extra time for it still not to work, but I called the store and my sales rep arranged to have their technician come back to look at it. Several visits, he thought possibly the power adapter missing batteries might be the problem. He came back a few days later, but that didn't fix the issue.  A week or so later, my dog jumped on that side of the sofa and the recliner kicked on and opened all the way. So I called the store and the technician, and the person at the store called me to arrange to have it picked up and for me to come back and pick something else out. I never asked to have it swapped out, and told her so. We had been looking for a sofa for months, so why would I want to return it for something else? I just wanted to get it fixed. I have made umteen number of calls, spoken to numerous people about the issue and no one has ever attempted to actually resolve the issue. In the beginning people would call me back, to tell me they were trying to get in touch with Colleen to offer me some resolution... but that has never happened. Over the months, every day or so when my toddler or dog walk across that seat, the recliner opens up all the way, we have to pull the sofa out, unplug and replug it in to get it to close. But the manual buttons still have never once worked. So about a month ago I called and left yet another message for Amber in their main office, stating that I was incredibly upset no one would get back to me to help me get it fixed, begging her to call me back... and surprise, surpise nope...I never got a call back. Finally today I did some research and located a phone number for the manufacturer and called them, they immediately offered to send out a part that will hopefully fix my issue. I dont understand why Colleen's didn't attempt this, or heck even just give me their contact information to call myself. It's such a shame. My sales rep Alaina was awesome, the staff has always been friendly... but they need to work on handling customer issues. I should never have had to make so many phone calls without ever getting any resolution. They could have easily just passed along the manufacturers information and suggested I contact them for warranty repair. I will probably still shop there on occasion, but will definitely have more reservations about what I purchase or recommending friends or clients to them.", "business_id": "qyfmrsvoguoAII2QKq2DiQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-06-16", "type": "review"}

One is that they will give you a free fitness assessment with your purchase.  For instance, if you purchase a treadmill, they will assess your fitness level and help you plan a workout regimen so you can achieve your goals.

I have been to Station Square several times and I have been disoriented each of those times.  A design shouldn't make you feel like you are lost at every turn.  It shouldn't make you feel like you have no idea where you are.  It's no wonder that the place is not filled with business nor with people.  \n\nSteps that need to be taken to make this place better:\n1. Think about the circulation.  It is very bad.  You can play with surprise in the design, but you need to leave people a tether back to a safe or known place.  Right now there is no tether.  There is nothing worse than feeling disoriented in a building.\n2. Ingress and egress is so difficult to find for Station Square.  It should be utterly obvious  the difference between a mall entrance and store or restaurant entrance.  If it is not obvious, then people will feel tricked.  Leave the Easter Egg hunts for Easter.\n3. This has been set-up as a tourist destination.  That is fine, but you need to make certain you have enough tourists to keep all the business afloat.  With only one hotel to easily feed an entire complex with tourists, something tells me that someone just threw this design together a tad to hastily.

They say that they deliver Havertys quality furniture at Ashley Furniture prices, and on this point, they truly deliver.  They recently opened a few months ago in the highly competitive \"furniture row\" part of Pineville, right next to the Carolina Place Mall.  They have agreements with over 30 manufacturers (Jaipur Home, Fairmont Designs, Aspen Homes, etc.) and bring in a lot of stuff that you won't find at the big-box furniture stores; reclaimed wood furniture is a favorite of my wife and mine, and they have that here in abundance.  Unfortunately at this time, I can only give this place 2 stars.  The customer service my wife and I have received since purchasing an Aspen Home full bed room set has been less than stellar.  Here's the back-story:\n  \nWe made the purchase on 8/10, and were told to expect delivery on 8/26.  8/25 rolls around, and we get a call informing us that our furniture is going to be delivered!  Oh, happy day.  We promptly call AmVets, telling them we have a sizable donation; our old bedroom furniture.  It has to be picked up today, because the new stuff is being moved in tomorrow.  AmVets is more than happy to oblige, and we are more than happy to give our old furniture to a good cause...everyone wins, right?  Wrong.  Savvy Spaces delivery people arrive; I've taken the day off of work, expecting to be moving furniture around and helping with the transition to the bedroom.  And the delivery guys show up with....a nightstand.  One ******* nightstand.  When asked where the rest of the furniture is, the guy says \"hey, we are a third party delivery service...this was all they gave us.\"  So we called Savvy Spaces, and they turned around and blamed it on the manufacturer.  So we called the manufacturer, and they turned around and blamed it on Savvy Spaces.  Finger pointing all around.  Meanwhile, I'm trying to figure out...How the hell do you sleep on one nightstand?  My wife and I haven't figured it out yet, but the dog loves the fact that we are sleeping on a mattress and box springs sitting on the floor....he thinks we are camping!\n\nFast-forward to today (9/23/2011)...we still have one nightstand sitting in our bedroom.  Almost a full month after delivery was promised.  Every time I call up to Savvy Spaces, I get more pissed.  They throw $100 credits at us in attempts to keep us from cancelling the entire order, but even with additional discounts, this is really getting to be more of a pain in the ass than it was worth.\n\nStay tuned...more information as this saga progresses...but for now, a word of advice.  Don't shop in this store unless you can \"Cash-And-Carry\".  Trying to get this company to deliver on any of their promises apparently requires an act of congress.", "business_id": "UWxrcUqO2mPYlTPlnLM7iA", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-09-23", "type": "review"}

If you're ever interested in anything to do with kayaks, these are the people you want to talk to.  It seemed like every employee I talked to was a kayaking expert.  I was actually interested in taking a kayaking roll clinic that they offer at the aquatic center uptown.  When I asked about the class the guy who was helping me got all excited and immediately got me fitted in a kayak.  He was extremely knowledgeable and took a lot of time making sure I had just the right fit.  He was so into the sport he practically gave me a beginner course on the subject, kayaking 101.  Next, I made it to the counter to pay for my 2 hour roll clinic session and the total was only $10 which included all equipment (which they bring to the pool so all you have to do is show up) and one-on-one time with instructors in the pool.  Are you kidding me??  Only $10??  For the price I assumed the pool session probably wouldn't be all that informative but I was pleasantly surprised!  There were several instructors available and they spent most of their time with the newbies.  All the instructors were wonderful and within 30 minutes of being in the water in my kayak I was able to flip the kayak upside down (with my head under water) and maneuver myself back on top of the water with my paddle.  It's actually not that easy to do the first time around but the instructors were so great I caught right on.\n\nBesides just the kayaking stuff this store has a plethora of outdoor goodies.

However, even for the (self-professed) eloquent writer that I am, this was a difficult review to write, but only because words are insufficient to convey their industrious work ethic, flexibility and cultural sensitivity,  excellent quality of the output.\n\nEveryone knows how painstaking and stressful wedding planning is, but not everyone knows that no matter how meticulous one is over the planning, not everything goes exactly according to plan on the day itself, or that the memories of the day are fleeting. Or at least, I didn't. As we embarked on the task of planning our wedding (foolishly innocent as we were, we didn't realize how arduous it would be), the first decision that we made was that we would have Chris and Alicia of Orange Soda Photo cover our wedding. I knew the couple from diving lessons three years ago, and I fell in love with them immediately. They are fun and easy to get a long with and their patience and dedication knows no bounds and I had already made up my mind then (when no thoughts of a wedding loomed in my mind) that they would photograph my wedding. My husband didn't know them, but he too readily agreed, persuaded by my comfort, even before he met them. It was the first decision we made, it was the easiest, and it was the best. \n\nThey tried to help in every way they could throughout the planning process, connecting us to vendors, giving us tips on negotiation, adjusting and readjusting their schedules to fit with ours. We were vague in our estimate of time. We told them we'd need them at 5am in the morning on the day of the wedding and that it would go on till about 3 or 4pm, and then that the reception would start at 6:30pm or 7 and go on till it ended. They were on board, unfazed by the long hours and the uncertain schedule. (Oh, and Alicia was due when they both did our engagement photos in Calico Basin. Yes, she trekked with us and took our photos. Talk about dedication!) It's not easy to plan a traditional Indian (Telugu Brahmin, to be specific) wedding in Las Vegas, let alone in 2 and 1/2 months, and needless to say, there were a lot of changes, up to the very last minute. Even the wedding ceremony went several hours over. Chris and Alicia were patient and accommodating, and always upbeat and positive. \n\nWe are very grateful to them for being there from the beginning for their support, dedication and for beautifully capturing moments that we missed. Our wedding day is more than just a vague memory, thanks to Chris and Alicia of Orange Soda Photo.

I walked in knowing NOTHING about re-seeding a lawn and I was scared to see what might be involved.  Folks at the register both said \"Hello\" in a genuine way.  I was asked if they could help me by 2 different people as we made our way to the grass section.  I was scared to admit I needed help at first.  Within about 20 seconds after looking at the grass seed, over walked our guy.  I really wish I could remember his name because he was awesome.  He said, \"You two look like you could use some help.  Let me point you in the right direction.  Whatcha looking to do?\" It was too good to be true.  So we told him tentatively.  He pointed us in the right direction, walked us over to show us options for equipment, talked about how to save money by doing it another way, and then gave us his personal tips on keeping birds off the grass without having to pay for some fancy tent system.  \n\nThis was our first experience, which is why it's stuck out to me, but I've been there a few times since then, and it's the same every time.

As she introduced me, I had to replace them as I had consumed the lot. This store also had an (equally) limited beer collection that included Innis & Gunn, one of my favourites and also not available in the supermarket closest to me. \n\nHowever, this Asda is a megastore which is alarmingly big. It does stock items that other stores don't have as it has the luxury of space to do so, but it also is overcrowded and hellish to move around. Note to consumers - if you want to shove your way down an aisle, logic should surely be jumping up and down in the quiet annals of your mind suggesting that if you let the folk leave the aisle first, that gives you more space to force your trolley through, without endangering fingers. No? Perhaps it is just me. I totally understand that you are much more busy than me and can't wait for my elderly parents to shuffle through, and you feel the need to push and shove instead. It also seems that the staff feel the same way, too. \n\nSo perhaps going to a hypermarket on a Saturday at lunchtime wasn't my best moment. \n\nIn addition, I have to say, that I have missed bread since living in the states, but when I look around the bakery section, I wonder why. Did I imagine the delicious baguettes and crusty bread? The onion bloomer I picked up was almost sticky on the surface and anemic to say the least. The freshly made cookies may have been freshly made, but they barely touched the inside of an oven, collapsing and pale, soggy to the taste. Highly disappointing, when in my mind I had believed even supermarket bakeries were a cut above the processed breads that were the majority in the US. Shame on my rose tinted mind. Not to mention the section where I used to find rye bread seems to have vanished. \n\nSo yeah, it will be good when I run out of items that I can't pick up elsewhere, like own-brand rice crackers, but lets face it, I'm pretty sure I will seal the deal with another supermarket in the area for my shopping of choice.", "business_id": "2TFIor-W0FNAdD1nCl693g", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-07-31", "type": "review"}

The layout makes me feel like I'm wandering through some kind of cosmetic labyrinth. That said, you can usually move around pretty easily unless the place is packed\n\nThe stuff: Sephora is bloody well-stocked with most major cosmetic brands, as well as brands I've never heard of. You'll find make-up, fragrances, some body products and assorted tools to make yourself real purty. I give them bonus points for carrying one of my favorite brands - Fresh, straight out of NYC. Also, if you're looking for travel-sized fragrances, this is the place to get them.\n\nService: The floor is usually well 'stocked' with clerks who will offer you bags for everything they want you to buy. However, unlike the downtown sore, I wasn't greeted or offered a bag. In fact, the service was non-existent. Guess it's a good thing I knew exactly what I needed and where to find it. \n\nPrice: It will really depend on what you're buying. We all know that certain brands are overpriced so if you're going for Lanc\u00f4me or YSL, you'll pay through the nose, however if you opt for something like the Sephora brand, you'll pay a little less. One thing is certain - you'll almost always find what you're looking for.\n\nBonus: If you get the Sephora card, you'll accumulate points that can be redeemed for products.

The irons were only $2 bucks and the drivers were $5 bucks to rent. Their driving range is two levels and we grabbed the lower level so we could have some shade. Their driving range is awesome. The next time we go I want to play the par 3 course as I heard it is pretty fun. When we went this time there was a tent sale with some pretty good deals. Since I have Callaway clubs this was a real treat. I refrained from purchasing anything but I must say if I wanted a new set that day that would have been a good day to buy it.

I had no complaints. But this time was something else.\n \nI took my wedding dress in to be altered, thinking foolishly that they would do a professional job. The staff was rude, and difficult to do business with but I tolerated it since the price was reasonable. I should have known something was wrong when they demanded payment up-front, and asked if I wanted Damage Insurance. This is my dress - why would I buy damage insurance?\n \nI explained that I would be out of town and would pick up after I returned (they didn't like that). Then I stayed in L.A. a few days extra, and I received a call that I HAD to come and get the dress or else....\n \nSo I had a friend pick it up for me. I finally tried on the dress to check for length, and was horrified to find that they had simply tacked the dress up in the front including the 2 layers of lining underneath. They didn't even bother to press it and try to make it hang correctly. They ignored the scalloped edges which are used on lace to make hemming easy - so the front of the dress had a thick turnover, while the back had the scalloped edge.\n \nIn truth I might as well have thrown the money out the window - thankfully I have the skill and equipment to do a hem like this, and so I personally cut the fabric, removed the scallop edge from the remnant, and re- attached it myself.

The prices are pretty cheap when compared to the hotel chapels in Vegas. The pictures here at this chapel is pretty expensive but they capture the moments to make your wedding that much more special. Now I do have so gripes about this chapel. I don't think it's reasonable to not allow the guest at the wedding to take pictures during the ceremony. I understand that the guest flash could throw off the pictures by the photographer but I still believe at some point the guest should be allowed to take pictures. Other weddings I have been to, the guests have taken picturess and the weddings still turned out good. Another issue that really upset me is the fact they I was not allowed to say my real vows. If you allow people to write their own vows then let that be. You can't give them the option but still dictate what can and can not but said. That eliminates the creativity of the couple. Lastly, the ceremony had to be restarted due to technical difficulties with the webcast. I'm very superstitious so I hope that isn't a sign of things to come. Now I got that out the way I loved the ceremony once it started. My bride and I worked with a lady named Michelle and she was very attentive to us and tried her best to accommodate our needs. She gave the best package for our money and the number of guests we had. She gave us numerous options to have our reception dinner and many are pretty reasonable. The chapel of the flowers take great pictures and capture the moments that we really wanted.  It started a little late but what wedding starts on time lol. The staff there is very nice and do there very best to make you comfortable. I'm not sure of the lady's name but she seen I was pretty nervous and she told me \"Mr. Jones, you need to have a sit and chill out\" lol. She talked to me about her family and where they were from. That took my mind off things. The minister, coordinator, photographers are all friendly. I absolutely love the pictures and it made me love my wedding day that much more. I would recommend this chapel to people.", "business_id": "rdLy9FgD5iJbEoDmd_0i9Q", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-09-25", "type": "review"}

It was an acrylic nail nightmare.  I needed a new set.  Just moved to Las Vegas so I am trying different nail salons to find the one I like this best.  This one was NOT it. When I walked in I was shocked ot say the least.  I was expecting a nail salon but it was so much more. Beauty supply, hair salon and nail salon, all in one!  The gentleman who did my set was nice...although he spoke not a word even though I asked multiple questions considering I wanted my hair done as well.  I requested a simple design. My grand daughter can do this one...and she's 9.  The woman who came to paint my nails stayed on the phone for 10 minutes, while I sat and waited, with her sitting right in front of me at the manicure table. When she finally got done giggling and laughing on the phone she started painting my nails...one stripe down the middle...when I asked her to paint the whole nail...she acted like I had just asked her to change the tire on my car!!  Then the design.  The paint she used was way too thick...and it clumped and curled on my nail...then she put the topcoat on and smeared the whole thing!!  When I pointed it out...she said it only smeared \"a little\".  OMGosh...I'm paying for a service....not smears. On top of it...there was nail polish all over my fingers. So I asked her to just take it off and paint my nails a solid color with no design.  The world came to an end at that moment.  She actually had the nerve to say, \"Yes, the design looked good in the picture, but didn't look good on YOU\"  Insult much??!  It wasn't that it didn't look good on me...it was that she did a horrible job!!   So she goes to take the polish off and uses something really strong....and it melted my new set of nails!!!  The gentleman had to come redo them!  By this time my fingers were burning...and I complained.  He told me to wash my hands...so I did. The burning stopped.  Then the girl comes back to paint my nails one solid color...and again...one stripe down the middle.  When I pointed it out AGAIN...she said she'd cover the rest on the second coat.  WTHeck??  I want two coats all over...not one coat in 'spots'.  She finished the tragic job, then charged me full price!!  When I complained about that...they said...\"new set 25.00!\"  So I paid...left and went to another salon and got my nails redone!  This was about a week ago.  My fingers were sore for 4 days!!  This place is unprofessional, and should not be allowed to be open to do nails.  I don't know about their other services...but if this is how they treat first time customers....RUN....RUN FAST, and don't stop at this dump!!", "business_id": "4QWJUYjJwaEpPyMhOPd90A", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-10-12", "type": "review"}

OK, I have been in the customer service field for 30 years so I think I qualify as an expert in the review!\n\nMy wife and I rent movies from this location because the one that was closer to our house closed...wonder why??? So we have been coming to this one for a while and we already know the drills on what is the \"Latest Deal\" they would be offering. However the last 4 or 5 times we have went in to rent movies (and we rent 8 movies or more sometimes at one time) we are getting basically harassed about getting on their plan for monthly purchases. We politely tell them \"no thank you\" hoping to proceed on but nope not the case! \n\nConsidering how much we go there and we are recognized by staff members you would think they would stop offering the deal to us. They don't though, they just insist that we get on the plan even after we declined. Then after repeated NO's on several different occasions my wife had to almost check an employee after declining again that we did not want to purchase a monthly plan!\n\nThis is why people have moved on to NetFlix, Redbox or just plain old not renting from a brick & mortar anymore! If the customer wants something after you offer then so be it but if the decline a product or service then they need to be left alone! \n\nC'Mon Blockbuster management when a customer wants to spend their money their way you need to let them! \n\nPull this stunt again...(pissing my wife off on her weekend off and then I have to hear about it at home because of your staffs poor customer service) I will take my business elsewhere and I will publicly via social media let people know what kind of operation you guys are running over there!!!

A standard annual membership is $45 and worth every penny for most households with 2 or more people. They also offer a Plus membership ($100) that allows you early access and additional discounts and savings. I tried their Plus membership for a few months, but didn't benefit from it at all. Anyway, you can add a second member for free and additional members are a fraction of the initial fee.\n\nI don't have many qualms about Sam's Club or have a preference for any of their locations other than pure convenience. So, right now my club choice is the one located near the corner of Rainbow Blvd and 215-West. This Spring Mountain location used to be the most convenient when my family's residence was in the vicinity, so it was primarily frequented. Now, it's become a place to simply fill up gas. It tends to be cheaper than its other Southwest counterpart, so if I'm in the area or with my parents, this is where we stop. I couldn't tell you the typical price difference, however, it's enough to make it worthwhile, though not enough to drive out of your way.\n\nIn any case, the consistently cheaper gas prices and low membership fees will definitely keep me coming back.", "business_id": "75qyCqXYNvQz00cqv02HZg", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-02-24", "type": "review"}

There are still Psychic Eyes in the Las Vegas area.  When they still had stores in the Bay Area, I used to go there, referring to it as \"the Costco of Occultism\" because they carried so much incredible stuff.  When I first stopped by the Vision Quest building, my first impression from seeing the outside was, \"It looks like Psychic Eye!\"  With that, I went inside, and my attitude changed from hopeful and curious, to confused, disappointed, and actually rather miffed.\n\nPsychic Eye had EVERYTHING from bulk incenses and oils to books (the Crowley was in a locked cabinet) to magical blades to wall sconces(!) to jewelry and any kind of occulty paraphernalia you could or couldn't think of.\n\nWhen I walked into Vision Quest, I was greeted by. . .bookshelves.  Lots and lots of bookshelves.  On these shelves, there were lots of copies of the same book laid face out for one or more rows so as to give them the illusion of looking full.  Had they been placed spine out, most of the bookshelves would have been substantially less than half filled, and the books that they did carry were largely crap.  I literally wandered from bookshelf to bookshelf looking for something interesting at each one, and was amazed at how few books of real quality I could find.  There was a small area in the center of the store with some crystals, and there was a case near the register with a little jewelry and some other non-descript stuff.  A few shelves and displays were also dedicated to 8 1/2 by 11 colored sheets of paper describing the specialties of the psychics and mediums who work at the site.  They aren't really selling crap here in the store, so this must be their main source of income.\n\nThis store is BIG, and really well-maintained.  They obviously put a LOT of money into the large Tarot card paintings that decorate the walls.  This place could be an occult powerhouse to rival Psychic Eye if they had the inventory to make it happen.  Instead, they have this huge, beautiful facility understocked with lousy books and a few crystals.  It was like using an ornate, sterling silver serving platter to serve a cold Quarter Pounder missing a bun.\n\nOn top of that, the sales lady just stayed by the register the whole time counting money.  We must have been in that store for 40 minutes, and all the while she didn't make eye contact, didn't even look up at us, didn't greet us, ask us if we needed help, or talk to us at all.   In addition, she had one music track playing on repeat over the speakers the whole time we were in there.\n\nVision Quest looks like it was really great at some time in the past.  Unfortunately, that time has come and gone.  From the terrible inventory to the non-existent customer service, few businesses say \"get out\" to their customers more than this.\n\nWhat is the point, really?", "business_id": "vbruEqj8eSqsgGkEkKzkig", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-08-07", "type": "review"}

What he fails to realize is most of us have smart phones and can call him out on his BS!  I picked out about 8 Stones LP's I did not have.  He asked me about 8 times if I was sure I wanted him to look up prices, like by the looks of me I could not afford the BS prices he was going to quote.  The first LP he looked up was a copy of Johnny Cash American Recordings 4.  He wanted $120 for a copy where the cover was rough and had deep creases.  He said its online for $140 so that's a deal.  In this condition maybe a $30-$40 record.  Next was a Stones album.  He wanted $50 because he found one online someone was asking $56 for.  I then pulled out my iPhone and showed him the same LP w/ a buy it now on eBay for $10.  It was in Europe so to save me shipping i offered $15.

Looking around, I noticed some VERY nice card cases.  Now, for a while, I was bemoaning my lack of an appropriate wallet, or just wanting a new one, and another friend gave me a metal card case that fit the bill nicely.

I had to explain to him that isn't how Yelp works.  He didn't get it. \n\nIf you plan on starting your own business here, I wouldn't suggest it.  Most vendors fail within their 1st 8 weeks...some even pack it up early after a couple weeks...before their rent is even due.  The rental contract is for 4 weeks.  It's not monthly, so you end up paying rent 13 times a year vs. 12 if you happen to be in the minority that manage to stay.  The least expensive booth in a bad location will cost you $7 a square foot ($695 every 4 week) not including 3 unnecessary move in charges.  Add it all up & you're looking at close to $1000 to move in, not including State & City business licenses as well as Insurance for your dinky 10'x10' spot.  The ones that have lasted are locked into lower rental rates from many years ago.  \n\nIt is very difficult for a new vendor to make any profit here or break even.  One of the owners asked me why people move out so fast.  I told him, they simply aren't able to afford being there.  His response, \"That 's what they say while they are running all the way to the bank.\"  This guy has some of the most moronic logic ever! \n\nFor example, looking at the photos posted on yelp, many of those businesses are no longer there.  The Greek restaurant, the crepe place, the nut guy, Vegas Crafts (cool wooden bowls), Mrs. Jones vinyl art, the empanadas guy (yes...there is a new one now) have all left.  Almost half of those photos are no longer relevant.  \n\nThe previous reviewer is correct about quality vendors not lasting.  They have a directory that is printed up once a month.  In many cases, by the time a new vendor is added to the directory...they have already moved out.  The clientele is like most of the products for sale...low quality & cheap.  The Feds have come in on multiple occasions to raid booths selling knock-off items & arrest vendors breaking the law.  The place has a reputation for this as I have seen it reported on the local news numerous times.  If you have high quality products or services to offer, look elsewhere.  Most of the clientele in here cannot afford nicer things.\n\nIn July of 2012 the building suffered a flood due to the old & outdated infrastructure, a pipe in the ceiling burst.  Many vendors were forced to either relocate to less desirable spots, move out of the building or shut down.  They are still in the process of renovating the flooded portion up to code, but are not renovating the rest of the building.  Don't be surprised if it happens again in the older/untouched section which is about 80% of the building. \n\nOSHA forced them to eradicate the damaged building materials & have it stored in a landfill for 100 years since it is deemed to contain asbestos & is considered hazardous waste materials.  Amazingly enough, the original/flooded main isle carpet is still intact almost 1 year later even though it got soaked (thus having asbestos in it as well.)  \n\nThe phone lines in the building are so old that on numerous weekends, vendors cannot ring up sales as they cannot run their credit card machines & customers cannot access cash from the ATMs on site.  Bring your cash beforehand just in case!\n\nThe biggest problems with the place is that it's mismanaged by a moody GM & the 3 part-time, out of state owner's inability to see just how lousy she is as a manager.  She is the #2 reason people move out...#1 being people just not able to make.  Rather than addressing the issues, they blame other factors.  It seems as though they suffer from cognitive dissonance.   \n\nShe has a temper & raises her voice unnecessarily while enforcing rules that she doesn't obey herself.  Not only that, but the rules always seem to change depending on who benefits.  For example, she tells people no animals allowed unless they are service animals, yet she will let her poodle (not a service dog) run about inside unleashed.\n\nOn a positive note, the staff & most of the vendors are good, honest, hard working people.  I can honestly recommend BroadAcres over Fantastic as a potential vendor or a customer & seeing the reviews, Yelpers agree!  Less expensive rent, higher traffic count, many more vendors, a better food/drink selection & places to actually sit while you eat.  Not too mention the performance stage & a liquor license which Fantastic can't obtain.\n\nI will not be back...even if they handed out free HAZ-MAT suits!", "business_id": "NZ0QNUAVGSKgjAFRQxdjUw", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-06-08", "type": "review"}

There are gorgeous rings, bangles and pipes. Bags, cases and incense burners are also throughout the store. \n\nMy favorite purchase here was a small singing bowl. I have wanted one for a very long time, but they are a costly investment.

Well its very convenient to my house. I live about 5 miles away. They're gas is pretty inexpensive compared to other pumps in the S. Charlotte/Pineville area. THey have a great selection of food. I like being able to buy food from them that can make three or four meals rather than one buying from Harris Teeter. They often have strange flavors of ice cream for sale that are cheaper than some of the national brands. They also have a great bakery. Like other wholesale clubs they carry a variety of merchandise other than food. \n\nIts a good place to look for movies. Best Buy used to be my go to store for movies. But they're prices are too high & their selection is terrible. \n\nThe other thing I really like about BJ's is that the employees are friendly.

The first thing I see as I approach is a reserved section next to the handicapped parking labeled \"Hybrid Only\" parking... okay, fine. They're really pushing the idea of them being \"Earth Friendly\"... pfft, don't make me laugh. We wander in and start looking at the generic looking products lining the shelves. \"Shipped in from France.\" What? How much gas did that take? \"Shipped fresh from Costa Rica.\" Ha! I'm sure that's cheaper and more Earth Friendly and fresher than just using local or even just closer suppliers. \n\nAnother thing we noticed as we walked through the two sets of triple sliding glass electric doors (very earth conscious and frugal) was that it was below 60 degrees inside. There are seriously big thick jackets for the employees to wear at the check stands. How much resources does it waste to keep it this cold? Especially in Arizona. I'm sure with all the CFCs being released, this place has a bigger energy footprint than a suburban block full of homes. Environmentally friendly, my dirty asshole. \n\nPerhaps the worst offense, aside from the fact that nothing is made here and instead is shipped in, is that it's all packaged in excess plastic. Everything is wrapped in plastic and in plastic trays. Even apples... I can't pick an individual apple, I have to get a little family of four and their little house too. I guess I could recycle it (if it didn't have a paper sticker on it - oops). Also, I get that part of the appeal here is the organic fad so there aren't any preservatives, but seriously - it seems like everything here expires like tomorrow. Not so Fresh, eh?\n\nLet me just hop in my Hybrid and head across town past 6 other grocery stores to the Fresh and Easy market where I can wander around in a frozen tundra environment grabbing food that's minutes away from expiring after being flown or shipped in from other countries on massive gas guzzling planes or ships then across our country in gas guzzling big rigs. Then I can check myself out and bag my own shit in plastic bags because the luxury of having someone else do it makes me feel useless after a long day at work. Then I can go home and really feel good about myself and the positive effect I'm having on the environment. \n\nIn their defense, the bags are reportedly 50% recycled material and they urge you to drive all the way back to the store so they can recycle them (they won't re-use them, but they'll send them out to be recycled - as far as I know, plastic bags aren't recyclable). \n\nWe bought fixins to make a pizza... I should've just gone to DeFalco's and bought the shit. There was a lot of stuff they just didn't have - they JUST got Pepperonis apparently (and they were just Gallo that you could get at any store). In fact, half of what they sell is their own Easy branding which is pretty generic looking (something I'm perfectly fine with). The other half is just the same shit you can get at any grocery store. \n\nTheir prices are pretty decent - I'll give them that. If they had one right down the street from me, I would probably shop at it once in awhile... and fill out comment cards frequently about their flagrant hypocrisies.

Now we are proud owners of a MacBook Pro. Anywho... \n\nI love coming into the Apple Store to check out new items before we buy them. We will usually visit our potential purchase 2 or 3 times before actually buying.

I found this place with amazing reviews. I called for an appointment with James, because other yelpers praised his talent. I went in just in time for my appointment and James greeted me. He was very nice and joked around, which made me feel more comfortable... UNTIL he went a little overboard with the compliments and asking me why I don't have multiple boyfriends. Then it got a little weird and awkward.\n\nI told him I wanted a reddish brown color, and he told me he would mix a few colors. His accent was a little bit indistinguishable at times, but he seemed like he knew what he was doing, so I agreed to his suggestions of mixing colors and whatever looks best on me. He finished my color, and when he dried my hair I could hardly tell the difference. My hair was still very dark, and the red was only seen in the sunlight. I figured It would get lighter after a couple washes, so I brushed it off. He DID cut my hair the way I wanted it. He kept it long, but still managed to cut the split ends off and layer my hair how I usually get it done.\n\nThe one thing that really pissed me off was in the middle of styling my hair he told me he needed to go to the bathroom, and of course I said go ahead. He came back after a few minutes laughing. He smelled of cigarette smoke. I asked him if he really went to use the bathroom and he told me he lied and he needed to smoke. Not only did he lie, but he just laughed it off, then he continued to style my hair with his smoke infested smelly hands. Not a very professional thing to do.\n\nLater that day I noticed my head was becoming itchy. I couldn't help but feel like something was wrong. I thought it was just a little dye irritation, but It got worse over time. Within two days my whole head swelled up like a balloon. My neck and back of the ears were so enlarged (where my hair usually rests when it is down). My face got swollen and my left eye started to close because of the puffiness. I had to go to urgent care right away!\n\nThe doctor told me I was having an allergic reaction to the dye, which is weird to me because i've dyed my hair countless times, and never has this EVER happened. I don't know what kind of dye he used on me, or if him mixing different things did this to me. All I know is that I'm not going back there ever again. I have to take 6 pills a day now, and these symptoms will last until the dye GROWS out off my hair, or until I CUT all of my hair off. \n\nI gave him one star because I liked the haircut, but the service and experience was the worse I've ever had!! ****PLEASE ASK FOR THE BRANDS/TYPE OF DYE THEY USE IF YOU DECIDE TO GO HERE SO THIS DOESNT HAPPEN TO YOU!!

They said they could try to polish away the marks but were afraid the polishing wheel would ruin the small side diamonds. I was pretty upset as I just couldn't accept my ring having flaws within days of receiving it. So I went to a different jeweler to get a second opinion, who also said they did not want to try it, and instead referred me to Farrar. \n\nAt Farrar, I explained why the other jewelers said no, but they immediately took the ring into their back room, and returned a few minutes later with it perfectly polished.

We decided on the ever-so-famous Little White Wedding Chapel. \n\nNICKEL AND DIME YOU TO DEATH: They kept charging for everything that was supposed to be included-- Example: We already paid our $200 and something in total, but charged an EXTRA $50 for NOT USING their minister, which is weird since a minister is not required in real life, for anything, ever.  \n\nUNPROFESSIONAL: When it came time to check in naturally they said we owed even more money than that even though I had paid in full. It's interesting because I asked several times for a receipt in the weeks prior so I would NOT have this problem. WHy is it SO hard to email a receipt?! So here I am looking like a cheapskate arguing with an angry, incompetent female who apparently doesn't have shit for math skills and can't get her head out of her ass long enough to explain what the F is going on.\n\nMONEY HUNGRY: They also said they'd record it in case we want to purchase an over-priced DVD, come to find out they never recorded it and gave our friends the run-around. The staff is ridiculous and rude. The organist who didn't even play for us asked my hubby for a tip because she \"doesn't get paid much.\" It's like this: Kiss my ass old woman, the ceremonies last 10 minutes, meaning you get a TIP every ten minutes. You didn't PLAY the organ for us. Of course my hubby tipped her anyway because he's a sweetheart.\n\nUN-SKILLED: If you opt for pics don't expect much. The photographer took every pic straight on. Every angle identical, no rule of thirds, no angle from above, below, or different sides... and forget lighting or anything else that makes a picture unique. (Not that I'm a professional. But I'm also not pretending to be a photographer like this dude.) Good thing we're a \"fun\" group and made the most of our photos. :) At least the photographer was a nice guy.\n\nSO! if you want a bunch of rude, incompetent, no-talent ass clowns you've found your venue.\n\nOn the plus side it's surrounded by porn shops and passed out hookers.

If Shakespeare rose from the dead and wanted to write a new tragedy, it would probably be about Neonopolis.  Act 1 would be the facility opening, Act 3 would be Jillians and the hope of Star Trek: The Experience coming here, and Act 5 would be Las Vegas Rocks closing.  Neonopolis is to Las Vegas like what the Virtual Boy was to Nintendo: both had noble dreams and looked excellent on paper, but both ended up being complete failures in reality.  \n\nQuick history about this place.  Most of the retail space was vacant throughout most the facility's history, and it was tough to fill the empty spaces with establishments.  Jillians was a fun arcade/lounge type of place similar to Gameworks and Dave and Buster's, but it suffered from badly maintained machines and overpriced games.  Not long before it closed, the fraternity I was in held a rush (recruitment) event in one of the banquet rooms in there, and while it was fun it was one of the few good things about Jillians.  The place closed shortly after.\n\nIt had a movie theater, but why go to a theater there when you could just go to another one closer to where you live, and where parking is easier?  Plus, the lack of air conditioning IN A DESERT made it difficult to lure moviegoers in.  It soon closed.\n\nThey later had a Poker Dome event.  It was a nice facility, and the spectator areas were pretty cool and high tech.  Unfortunately, watching people play poker is nowhere near as entertaining as actually playing poker.  In fact, watching Garry Kasparov play chess would probably be more exciting than watching poker.  Now while some of you might enjoy watching poker on television, I just can't get into it.  Needless to say, when the champion was crowned, they didn't do this again.\n\nWhen Star Trek: The Experienced closed down at the Hilton, Trekkies like myself were heartbroken.  However, we were relieved when told that The Experience would be relocated to Neonopolis.  Unfortunately, after numerous auctions selling props from The Experience took place, it's relocation to Neonopolis is about as likely as Captain Picard manning the Starship Enterprise again.  The Experience remains stranded in the Delta Quadrant, and Neonopolis remains in the Neutral Zone.\n\nLas Vegas Rocks closing looks to be the final nail in Neonopolis's coffin.  It's quite sad, really.  Neonopolis had everything in paper to be THE revitalization for the Downtown area.  And while First Friday and the large number of plush and comfortable bars and lounges are revitalizing the area in itself, Neonopolis remains a proverbial ghost town, a reminder of what could have been, but never was.\n\nPROS:\nFilmmaker looking for a creepy, deserted place?  Here you go!\n\nCONS:\nEverything\n\nTHE VERDICT:  Just pretend it never happened.", "business_id": "PJoiSHK9Pf9BNKf_xB9gFA", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-02-25", "type": "review"}

There were pieces on display from artists such as Clemente (one of my favorites),Lichtenstein, Degas, Renoir, and a few from Picasso among others. In the admission price you get an audio reader of sorts to further describe certain pieces of art but the room was literally the size of a 3 bedroom apartment. It's your basic small gallery with wood floors and white walls.  In comparison to museums like the Whitney, MoMa, and Guggenheim the prices are comparable but not the quantity. Of course the Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art could never compete in the sizes of those museums, but the prices should reflect the quality and quantity of artwork. I feel like this was the Bellagio's attempt to add to it's ambiance of  refinement by adding this gallery which ended up just feeling like a cheap novelty of a museum.

I used to live by this Savers and would frequent it every day yes, literally every day back when they used to have great items. Just pop in real quick. Over time they changed the layout and experimented with things. \n\nAfter visiting today I saw that now everything is so crowded based on the way they structured everything using the same space with the same amount of stuff. The shoes are racked above the clothes racks now. This is extremely, extremely annoying. There is no emoticon to express how annoyed I am by this move. I understand they are trying to make the shoes central to the clothes so they are in the same spot, the shoes are racked by size of course snaking down each aisle. Sooo to look at shoes you have to go down a couple of aisles waiting for people to get out of your way, rather than have them in one spot like they used to be. Of course people are not going to magically put back shoes where they belong so you might find shoes in the right place, or you might end of having to walk down each and every aisle looking at the shoe size stickers making sure they are not cute and your shoe size respectively. Savers, please correct this annoying inconvenience. \n\nAlso if you genuinely find an item with a tag missing they won't sell the item to you. Listen I get it, this is such a high traffic thrift store that there is a good reason for this but you must wait until the next day for them to price the item and put it back, they won't hold it for you. They don't call a manager over to simply price the item out for you, so how is this good customer service for the innocent ones? Why punish everyone? Why not do like some other stores do and mark the clothing label with a washable marker so that way if the price tag comes off, based on the color they have a pricing system set up? Either way, end up taking the time to re-price and re-stock it again. \n\nThey should also implement some type of buzzer at the jewelry counter, I don't know how many times I have gone there, not just this location, only to wait and wait finally having to ask a cashier to send someone over to help me because there is never anyone there. The service is always impatient at the counter too, I don't know about you but I like to make up my mind about a purchase!

As an example, a really nice, dark wood dining set ran about $400 for the table and $150 for each chair, whereas the Ikea set for 8 we ended up purchasing cost about $500 total. While these prices are much more reasonable than a place like EQ3, they are definitely higher than some people looking for a lot of furniture (and not just a few pieces) might be willing (or able) to pay. \n\nWe did end up purchasing one thing, however. It was a beautiful eat-in table with funky aluminum legs and a glass table top - you could choose from 3 different sizes of tops. I believe the table ran about $250, but it looks really sleek. In the end, we still decided to go to Ikea to get the chairs (paid $100 instead of $300), but I am still glad we walked away with one upgraded piece! Don't get me wrong - I have nothing against Ikea. I love being able to add simple but clean-lined decor to my house at very affordable prices. But it's nice to differentiate now and then, and if you have a bit more to spend on a lot of furniture or are looking for a piece that's unique, I would highly recommend Eurway.", "business_id": "r1b_Lt2AlCvhPGK9sIkzFg", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-06-18", "type": "review"}

Well, I got my things done earlier in the day and I had to visit one of Phoenix's malls. My GPS told me about the MetroCenter Mall. It looked big on the GPS and I decided to that way. Maybe it was a mistake to head this way....\n\nI arrived to the MetroCenter Mall around 10am after a busy morning doing some errands. Since I am an L.A. Guy, most malls are always full of cars. All I saw was nothing..A BIG NOTHING. There were a few cars, but the parking lot was HUGE. I thought this area was infected by zombies or something. Then, logic kicked in and I knew the economy had to be an issue. The mall seems like a place, in the past, where it was a watering hole for the locals. Now, it is dead quiet.\n\nI walked in at the SportsChalet side and it was confirmed. It was dead quiet. It was quiet and a lot of the stores are empty and closed. The only thing going on around there was the food stores, a couple kiosks, and a lot of sports apparel stores. Really?! It was depressing inside. I am not even sure why this mall is even running.\n\nI walked up to a Customer Service Desk and asked of things to do. I was given great advice by the lady. She is the only reason why I didn't give the mall a One-Star Rating. She gave me some activities to do, but I didn't get to do any of them because of my time frame. After asking her, I continued on to nothing. \n\nWhen you think of a mall, you think of lots of activity, but this is just one big million dollar nothing. How is this business even running? There is a theme park next door, but that is also quiet. It was a weird feeling, but reality kicks in and you know you are witnessing how the economy is affecting business. Oh wow, there is nothing really to do here. The only time it will get busy is Christmas when temporary shops set up and sell. Time to leave this void and hopefully it will be better, if I return. \n\nThe Yelp Universe.

He gave me a women's \"short styles\" magazine to look through and flipped it page by page for me till the end and I didn't like any of them. Suddenly, he looked up and said WAIT... then returned with a MEN's short hair magazine. Haha! and sure enough there was a style I liked. I wanted something edgier and essentially super short while still framing my face in a nice way because I have a pretty round and \"baby-ish\" face.

We chose to have my son's party at Make Meaning this year because we have a three week old baby; I knew I would be exhausted and busy, and I wanted to make sure our older son still had a great party.\n\nWe chose the private party option.  They also offer a \"mini party\".  The private party was 90 minutes long and included 2 crafts for the kids to do.  We chose pottery painting and making soap cupcakes as the crafts.  It also included pizza and a Tammy Coe cake.   The assistants who work at Make Meaning run the crafts and serve the food.  They did a fantastic job, especially David, who really engaged with my son and all of the kids.  He and the other \"Aces\", as they are called, were all nice and helpful.  My son chose to paint a truck.  Some kids chose mermaids, footballs, princesses, etc.  They had quite a few options to choose from.  They provide mini aprons to help keep the kids' clothing clean.  At the end the guests get to take home their creation.  \n\nI was amazed by how smoothly the party went.  They transitioned from crafts to pizza to cake without making anyone feel rushed. The staff even accommodated a few guests who had arrived late by setting up a small table for after the party where they could finish their creations.  One of the best things about hosting a party there is that someone else does all of the cleanup- my least favorite part of a party....\n\nAs others have mentioned, Make Meaning is pricey.  We were on the fence about having the party there because of the expense.  In the end, we feel like it was well worth it.\n\nOverall, we were pleased with everything about the party.", "business_id": "iJLs1eO6CjqJQrbahhrKyg", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-02-12", "type": "review"}

Na twee weken in trainingsbroeken wandelbroeken en joggings rondgelopen te hebben doolde ik door Princes Street in .... een ter plekke gekochte knalroze regenjas (deze van hier zijn niet bestand tegen het Schotse weer) en een soort licht ribfluwelen cargobroek. Ik voelde me opeens h\u00e9\u00e9l ongelukkig, ik wilde er weer wat hipper uitzien. Dus toog ik naar Marks & Spencer, want die heb je hier op het vasteland niet meer.

Ja sorry, ik ben een Anglofiel, ik vind het ook zalig om aangesproken te worden met \"hi darling, can I help you?\".\n\nIk zocht dus: een iet of wat hippe jeans (niet dat je in deze stad vreemd aangekeken wordt als je je buiten de norm kleedt, integendeel, er lopen hier zoveel vreemde vogels rond dat je je in elke outfit eigenlijk op je gemak kan voelen).\nIk trok met een boyfriend jeans (ik spreek van 2 jaar gelegen) in size 14 en 16 naar de paskamer.\nAan de ingang werden de broeken overgenomen door een vriendelijke dame die me een kleedhokje aanwees, de jeans aan de haak hing en me het belletje toonde.

He was smoking about 2 pack of cigarettes a day and decided that after 25 years of that, he needed to start cutting back.  Oscar was extremely helpful and gave him a ton of information about the different items that they had.  A couple of days later we both went back to get him a starter kit.  Oscar recommended a few of the less expensive items so my husband could see if he would even like it.  My husband ended up getting an iPV and a Nautilus Aspire tank, claiming that he wouldn't be wasting the money.  Oscar walked him through the set-up and set him up with a nicotine level that was comparable to his cigarettes.  Within 4 days, he stopped smoking all together.\n\nA few days later, I went back because I kept taking my husband's but the nicotine was too much for me (I don't use any).  Alex set me up with a Nautilus Aspire Mini and an itaste vv.  He was extremely friendly and helpful. He put everything together for me, showed me how it worked and had me try about 20 different juices (out of about 120 different flavors) until I found two that I loved.\n\nTwo days after I got it, one of the two coils burnt.  I went back and John (a guy that I had never met before) replaced the coil free of charge and hooked me up.  When I thought that I had broken the itaste (about a week later), I went back and John informed me that there was a safety feature on it to prevent it from shorting out.  I just needed to clean it.  Again, John took care of me and got me vaping again.\n\nFrequently when we go to get more juices or accessories, Jordan is working.  She is always smiling and outgoing.  The other day when we went in, Jordan said that they had just gotten some new juices in and asked if we wanted to try them.  They were totally AWESOME!!!  Had to get the Ruthless (brand) Mandingo (flavor); it tastes just like fresh banana bread!\n\nWe went back today and Jordan helped me find a new drip tip that would fit my Nautilus.  As other customers came in, she told them that she would be right with them and I informed her that I literally had all day and I could wait.  Jordan kept checking on me in case I wanted to see anything or if I had any questions.  When all was said and done, I got my new tip and am considering a new mod that she was showing me.  At the price they have it for, I'd be a fool not to get it there.\n\nI would definitely recommend this place to other people and my husband and I refuse to go anywhere else.

I unwittingly missed out on a great resource!\n\nInconspicuously tucked away between the Royal Mile and The Mount, I guess it could be easily missed. Trees lead you into the gorgeous courtyard outside it, and it looks as though it's rich private property more than a tribute to acclaimed Scottish writers. But look below your feet and see quotes from the works of Barbour to MacDiarmid laid out on stone plaques. Follow the tributes up the stairs and you're there.\n\nWith the rich red walls and winding staircases, there is a glorious feel of the old in this free tourist attraction. The museum is petite in size but dedicates a floor to Burns, Walter Scott and Louis Stevenson respectively. They have waxworks and pipes smoked by our heroes which is interesting for fanatical tourists, but for the die hard Scots lit enthusiast they also have sights significant to our literary history, including parts of the Bannantyne printing press.\n\nI don't mean to adhere to a stereotype, but Americans were going nuts for the Burns stuff when I was in. It's interesting, so I don't blame them - the society have acquired some intricate belongings from the writer himself. Similarly, you can gander Louis Stevenson's crockery that he used for dinner parties in Samoa. I found peace in this room as I love Louis Stevenson's work, especially the South Sea Tales. They had a lot of pictures displayed of his time spent there, not to mention boots of his that he wore around the island. \n\nThere is a good amount of information decoarted around each of the writers' rooms and early copies of books displayed under glass cabinets. There is also a gift shop of sorts, which largely keeps with the theme and sells books.\n\nSmall, but useful, and set in a gorgeous old turret shaped building. I can see tourists enjoying this attraction as much as people interested in the history of Scottish literature, although one market I would say it would be unsuitable for is children.

She had already found \"the one\" somewhere else. However she tried a few more here. The only frustrating thing was they did not give prices, only kept saying it was in or out of price range. Which can be very frustrating. After not finding another dress better than the other, she showed it to the sales lady and they said they would price match. This was awesome for her so she purchased the gown from here. BTW, the sales lady was very nice. She made the experience a good one and the set up (we had a large group therefore had an area to ourselves) was really good. \n\nThe 2nd time however was horrible! We set an appointment for dresses. We had already decided on Dessy at another location. We had two dress styles but was open to another designer, just needed the right color. When we arrived, the receptionist tried three incorrect guesses at why we were there even though we had made an appointment. We then waited twenty minutes. The selection was small but we were optimistic. Finally our saleslady came out. We explained the situation and aske dto look at color samples from some of their other lines. She just kept saying, \"Well we don't have many dresses in this line, so....\" We kept trying to question about various colors and dresses, but she clearly wasn't interested in servicing us. She offered no information. Never suggested we try anything. When we told her the two dress styles we wanted, we had to ask her to look them up for pricing. She looked up the first one and offered us a \"guess\" at price because it wasn't listed. We then had to ask her to look up the second. Both of them were horribly expensive ($50 more than the retail price at the other location.) Finally we gave up and left. Clearly this specific salesperson was NOT interested in make a 6 bridesmaid dress sale. Ugh!!\n\nSo I would suggest if your a bride this place is good.

The next five minutes on the call was horrible.  I told her I needed to talk to someone else...so I hung up and called back.

I can only dream of the day when I win the lottery and can afford to purchase all the beautiful clothing, accessories, and home decor.  To be fair, not everything is highly priced, and they have a large selection of sales items that are within my budget...but I swear, if I won the lottery, it would be my first stop (2nd stop, Z Gallery).  It's always beautifully decorated and has a lovely cozy/eclectic feel to it that I absolutely adore.  They also carry my favorite perfume there.  As a general rule, I never buy myself perfume, because I always get some for Christmas (this is on the xmas list this year!), but the sales associates always look the other way when I come in just to spray it on myself before going out for the night...tacky, I know...but it smells sooooooo delicious.\n\nPart two - My apologies to the sales associates that delt with my crabby, frustrated, snotty attitude the night you couldn't find the item I had put on hold.  Apparently, a friend had come in to purchase the item as a gift to me.  After searching forever, one sales clerk 'in the know', finally came over and explained that the item had been purchased as a gift, and warned me to act surprised.  I sheepishly left, but still feel that an apology is due.  The sales clerks handled my attitude graciously and courteously, and I wanted to recognize that as a HUGE reason why I will continue to frequent this amazing store (sorry again!!). :)", "business_id": "ORLTCEgKfdxMuGPhIc1O9Q", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-12-14", "type": "review"}

The greeting was very genuine and not forced. Fortunately, the store was not packed, so we were helped right away. The woman who assisted us, Molly, was incredibly helpful. She was knowledgeable, patient, not pushy and had a little bit of sass. We had an idea of what we wanted when we went in, but Molly provided us with some great tips on our new phones, which we wouldn't have known about otherwise. I find company cell stores to have very pushy employees, we did not find this the case at all.

You walk into the storefront into a cavern of bike things and bike parts. Literally things stacked everywhere... with a narrow aisle that you can just barely walk with your bike through. The back of the store is a mechanic room that has several stations/stands where you can work on your bike - it's a bit more open, but also lined with shelfs and stacks of parts, and tools and scrap. There always seems to be people there who are willing to help or offer their opinion on how to do things. Gerry is also willing to help you with any other things you don't know or can't figure out by yourself. This is an awesome shop if you need anything special, if you lost a bolt or a nut or any other little piece that you can think of and need a replacement, this is the place to go. I love that you can spend an afternoon fixing up your bike your self, and having any of the tools or parts that you would need available and also at the cheapest possible price (for the parts). First time I was ever there, Gerry greeted me nicely, and invited me back into the shop to do the the work myself. I consulted him a couple of times - it was a busy afternoon at the shop, but he told me what i needed to do... and left me to play with it myself. I'm sure if you know nothing about bikes, or are working on a more complicated issue, he would have just as much insight, though I still get the feeling that he expects you to learn and pull your own weight in the repair/maintenance of your bike. I like that do-it-yourself attitude, but if you are looking for a place to drop off your bike and have the shop do all the work, this is probably not the place. \n\nAs far as Gerry being gruff... i didn't have that experience, really, but I see what people mean. I think he is not that outgoing and personable in a superficial way, but is willing to help or talk to anyone who wants to learn about their bike or needs help. Supported by the theory that he is not running this business to make a ton of money, he is not going to kiss anyones ass or go out of his way to make you feel welcome.", "business_id": "HzZmhlRNLtPkMI0egh9Oig", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-08-16", "type": "review"}

Hot cocoa & cider is $1.00 and kettle popcorn is $5.00. There is a cute little girl wearing a Christmas Tree outfit asking if you want hot cocoa or hot cider (kinda reminded me of Grease 2). Because of the disappointment with the cocoa in the past, we went to 7-11 to get our hot cocoa (we have the refillable cups) before we drove out there. Upon paid entry, you will get a goodie bag (discounts & coupons) and brief directions- ie. radio station in tune, turn of all lights, do not stop.\n\nIt seemed to be much longer and much better than when the event was held at Sunset Park- about 24 minutes compared to about 15 minutes on average. They made good use of all the archways and tunnels creating nicer light displays for us to enjoy. There was one towards the end that ended up being my favorite part- it was a huge rectangular continuous display- about 60 feet long, I am guessing (if you can think of the top and sides only being lighted since we were driving underneath it)- just beautiful and spectacular. There were the usual sponsors like US Bank and Fox 5. The lights included fairytales- Humpty Dumpty, Shark Reef, a jewish display, candy canes, christmas trees, etc. \n\nThere are some people carrying flashlights along the way to help guide you as well as cones and signs too. But at times, we had to turn on the lights. The guy behind us was in a mad hurry too, which was annoying, but we ignored him. Tip: do not rush through this.\n\nAlthough it's been raining here the last few days, the weather was quite mild last night when we went- it was a bit windy, but that's it.

If anything he was charming enough that I didn't actually call the owner of the store.  I accompanied  my wife today to purchase a Pandora charm bracelet and some charms to go with it. John was nice enough to take time helping us, and showing us many charms and bracelet styles. Now as my wife was questioning John about the $140 package they had advertised and the free charm they had advertised for spending 100 dollars, in comes the \"Manager.\"  There was talk of the chain lengths being too long for the $140 package. This made no sense, since the cost of the chain was the same no matter the  size. However, the manager was going to swap the wifes chain size for the \"packaged\" one; well how nice for us.  Then,  after we picked our charms, we were asked what charm we wanted  for free out of the charms we chose. I asked why this mattered, we chose 2 charms one comes with the package and one is free as advertised. The price should be the same either way. The manger decides she is going to lecture me on how business works, and how most businesses would not give the more expensive charm for free, but I could already tell from the total she was about to tell me how she had done us this great big favor.  So I began explaining to her that in the past I had also been a manager, was well aware of how business works, explained the principle of acceptable loss. I.E. It's much better to take a 5 dollar loss to make a 185 dollar sale with an almost guaranteed chance of having a repeat customer that also drums up word of mouth positive advertisement, then losing a 190 dollar sale and having someone slam you on YELP.  However, the whole conversation was MUTE because either way the price should have been the same.  Anyway, as I am, explaining to this person who has now made the overall process 10 minutes longer, by getting involved in the sale in the first place, this \" manager \" turned her back on us and told John to finish us up.  YOU NEVER TURN YOUR BACK ON A CUSTOMER, all this lady did was take a fun experience and make it awkward and hateful. The best advise I could give this woman is if you plan to stay in retail sales, take off those ridiculous heels and put on a smile. Your overall attitude is soul crushing in a place that is supposed sell tokens of  love, joy, and happiness.  Secondly, think about taking some courses from Dale Carnegie, it would do you wonders and probably raise your profit margin.", "business_id": "LfRBFljunPMQ44gkP7sMsQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-12-26", "type": "review"}

They have to pay for employees, insurance, bills AND their merchandise.  It isn't like it just drops from the sky.\nI think you'll find very reasonable pricing here with some very good finds if you are willing to shop for awhile.  They try to catch the top brands, but their prices are good and let's face it, if they can get $10 for a $75 top then they should.  If you don't like it, wait a week and it will be $5 (or sold because you didn't buy it when you should have).\nFriendly staff and management, ample parking, nice cold a/c and open until 9pm.

I asked to speak to his supervisior and was told he would take my number and someone would get back to me in 24-48 hours.

So if you are staying on or anywhere near the strip they will pick you up.  We appreciated this and made sure we gave a good tip to the driver.  Of course nothing is really free in Vegas....which is why the driver had a big cup with \"TIP\" written on it and 5 dollar bills hanging out of it...lol.\n\nWhen we arrived, we headed to the counter and they started their package sales pitch again.  I am not a gun lover, nor am I really interested in shooting, so I thought that the prices were outlandish.  They never said on the phone that we could not share the packages and the cheapest was about $130-$150.  Not once did they mention the a la carte pricing if you didn't want a package.  I asked them if they had any shared packages, and they told me that it was $500.  I can imagine spending this kind of money if I were going to buy a weapon, but not just shooting a couple of rounds...Good Grief!  We then asked if we could just rent an M4 each, and they started telling us the individual gun rental prices.  We both chose an M4, and a handgun to shoot ($50 for the M4, and about $25 for a 9mm or a 500).  Of course I chose the pink gun to go Rambo style :-)\n\nMy range person was very good.  He knew I was terrified of that big pink gun, so he took his time to calm me down.  He made sure he explained everything and even cheered me on when I had my doubts.

My review is focusing mainly on the customer service, not necessarily the products.  You either get why someone would spend thousands of dollars on bag or you don't.  And if you're going to drop big money on anything, I think you should at least like it enough to want to give it five stars.  So that's why this review isn't about their merchandise. \n\nI went to Scottsdale Fashion Square in search of a new bag for work.  When I went into Louis Vuitton, a sales associate came up to me and asked if she could assist me.  I had done a little research on their website to identify pieces that I wanted to look at in person.  There were really only need three bags I wanted to see.  As I told her the ones that I wanted to look at she seemed a little annoyed that I wanted to look at more than one.  It might have just been her demeanor, but I think if you're going to work at a place that sells high-end items then you should at least smile.  My plan was to pick up a wallet as well.  I felt uncomfortable even asking her if I could look at the wallets because she was so cold.  I found it odd that she would stick her hand out for me to give her the wallet back in order for me to look at the next piece.  It made me feel like she thought I would steal it or something.  Also, I wasn't really able to compare each piece with each other.  At that point I just left.  I was no longer in a shopping mood.\n\nBut then I still needed a bag for work so I went back the next day.  This time an associate named Julian help to me.  From the start he was the perfect balance of cheerful and professional!  This time I felt comfortable enough to really examine the bags.  I took my time and Julian was really patient with me.  He laid out each piece that I wanted to see so that I could compare the size and structure of each bag.  Once I had made my selection Julian made sure that I didn't go home with the floor model, so that it was a brand-new piece that had not been handled by many people!  \n\nOnto the wallets!  Again I was able to have the pieces laid out so that I could compare them.  I asked him if I could get my initials hot stamped on the wallet, complimentary service that they offer.  I didn't have to wait long for my wallet to get hot stamped, which made me really happy.\n\nBecause of my experience on my second trip,  I feel confident that I chose the right bag and wallet for me.", "business_id": "sHByBH-HDHk5xqfSp3r7Zw", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-11-13", "type": "review"}

They also have standard flower girl dresses, cheap jewelry, bridesmaid dresses, and \"grandma/ mom\" dresses.\n\nWe came here looking for bridesmaid dresses back in January. I'm the MoH in my friend's upcoming wedding this June. The store wasn't very busy, but the staff all seemed to be. We asked them for certain dresses to try on that the bride had found on their website- she brought the dress numbers and even had called ahead to confirm they had them in-store. The lady who went to look for the dresses came back with two out of the five. Said they didn't have the other three. \"Yeah right...\" I thought. I went to go look through the racks myself and ended up finding the other three. She was no help, and either lazy or gave up looking when she let herself be distracted by someone else. When she finally decided to check on us again, she saw we were wearing some of the other dresses she didn't bring us. She said, \"Wow! Where did you find those?\" They were on the rack. Where did you think I looked? The bride ended up choosing one of the dresses, and we went to order. The lady took our measurements. The size dresses she told us to order seemed a little off. We all know it's not going to me your normal dress size for these fancy dresses, but it was still going to be too big for most of us. We picked our own dress sizes. I think they just try and make more money from alterations. Then she asked us to order online on their website at home. Strange... Well, we did, and I got a conformation email. \n\nI called over a week ago to check on the status of my order, and to update the address it was going to be shipped to. The woman on the phone kept putting me on hold. She asked me for a bunch of information, and then at the end of the call, asked me to email the same information to their store email address. Really? And she didn't tell me the status, just that they would email me back. Eight days later, haven't heard anything. \n\nCalled again today, lady put me on hold. I was on hold for 15 minutes before I just hung up and called again. Pretty sure she forgot about me. The lady who answered the second time I called told me the order should be in \"early this month\" and it would be 5-7 business days to get it from the designer and then once it's in store they'll call me and send it out to my address. I sure hope so. But after the customer service we've received, I'm prepared for the worst.

When I opened my last pair of contacts, i discovered that one of the containers was empty. No contact, no solution. It had been over a year since my last appointment, and they couldn't give me a trial pair of contacts until I had an eye appointment with the doctor. I understand this, I'm fine with this. I would have loved if someone would have gotten to the point instead of running me in circles. What should have been an easy fix turned into being placed on hold 8 different times in one conversation, being told to call a different location to try and seek help 3 times, and no one knowing what to do. You know what would have fixed this situation? Setting up an eye appointment for me, and providing a free pair of contacts. This conversation took 45 minutes. I called two locations multiple times. I was disconnected twice, and somehow reached the voicemail 3 times while attempting to get back in touch with the person I was talking to. Neither location had any idea what to do and they only answer I got from ANYONE was to call a different location to get help. No one wanted to take responsibility or give suggestions on how to resolve the issue. I flat out said \"I don't know what I should do\" and I was told to keep calling locations until someone figured out what to do. So somehow after repeating myself to 5 people for almost an hour, I talked to someone who seemed to know what to do. I updated my information with her, confirmed an appointment time with her. Finally we are going to get somewhere. NOPE. Hours later I got a call because they don't take my insurance. What the hell, people? What is wrong with you guys? Get your shit together.

This year my gift to my guy was a first golf lesson for both of us.

We took a cab from the Wynn (Why didn't we use their greens? Don't know!) and we arrived early. I checked in at the front desk and was told that the pro was waiting for us. I was instructed to \" look for the white man with dark brown hair\". Yes, really. At a golf course I was sent to look for a white man. That was literally everyone there except for me, her and my boyfriend. So, after one unsuccessful lap around looking for the pro, I returned to the desk to get more specific instructions. We did finally find him and our lesson commenced. He was a great guy and I am happy that he gave us our first lesson. I was only bothered that during our lesson he put his hand on my head (part of the lesson) to hold it down without asking permission. It was my first lesson, so perhaps this is normal? I did not like it either way. However, the lesson was enjoyable and he was a gem.

I'm going to try and break this down:  I've unfortunately visited quite a bit this past month now that I just bought my first home.\n\n1.  Management - by and large pretty helpful, though you rarely get a call back when they say you will.  In the 5 calls I've made and had to deal w/ managers and assistant managers - only once did I get a call back....and that was only b/c she had to check on something and get back to me.  I wonder if the delay isn't b/c they are retail and don't necessarily work consecutive days?\n\n2.  Store associates - pretty friendly, though I'm knocking off stars here for the very very unprofessional behavior I witnessed last night.  I was making an appliance purchased and inquired about any special financing offers.  The sales associate was nice enough and while ringing me up did her best to call different departments to find the answer.  This took a few minutes, so another cashier came up and asked \"what exactly are you trying to need, can I help.\"  To which her fellow cashier FLIPPED out.  It was just wild.  There was yelling and she eventually walked off.  She wasn't yelling at me, but at her fellow coworker.  I'll try and quote but it went something like this \"if I need your help I'll ask for it....here you finish\"  and she walked away.  I was just gobsmacked.  I was really in a rush or I would have reported the issue to a manager.  No excuse to treat your fellow employee that way.  According to the sales associate who was just trying to help 'that's just the way she is.'  WTF?\n\n3.  Delivery drivers - first experience very negative....2nd experience pretty positive.  I had the same driver.  He apologized for any \"misunderstanding\"  I accepted it and moved on.\n\n4.  Service guys - first rate.  They tried and tried to get my first washing machine to work properly.  \n\nSo there you have it.  All in all this is the best stocked Lowes in the Charlotte area I think - probably b/c of the proximity to corporate.

He asked whomever in the background and she said \"if we haven't called then they're not ready.\" \"Really I said, but you've had them since Saturday.\" \n\n*Insert muffled background talking here*\n\n\"Can you call back, we're really busy.\" Click.\n\nWTH?\n\nI'm of course thinking they lost my stuff or something. They actually called me back in an hour and said that they had gone through it and I could come get it anytime after Thanksgiving (T-day was the next day). Well I had family in town all weekend and had to work on Monday. So on Tuesday they call me to tell me that if I don't get down there soon they would donate my stuff...grrr...if they had called me when they were supposed to and when I had time to come pick it up, this wouldn't be an issue.\n\nSo I make arrangements to rush down there before they close at 7 and get my stuff. Come to find out they took NOTHING and I still have 5 bins in my garage. I had some boutique-y clothes and gymboree clothes in there and they left it? Sheesh! I got about $30 for whatever they did take and had to lug home the rest.\n\nSoo, I probably won't take my kids stuff there for them to purchase again. It was too much of a hassle. which probably means I won't really shop there to much since it's a little out of my way. But I wouldn't say never. we'll see..", "business_id": "14Vblulf4FcO_i2DCCdxIQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-01-08", "type": "review"}

The only positive is that they have everything out for you to test and play with, and not locked behind glass. So, if you're in the market for a Sony product, you can go here and get the hands-on experience.\n\nHowever, the staff is completely inept. They do try to be nice, but they know nothing about computers. My wife was in the market for a Vaio laptop and had some basic questions to start, a couple of which the manager was able to answer, and most of which I had to find out myself by inspecting the laptops. We targeted the F series because my wife likes to play video games and to be portable. Once the manager got wind that she plays video games, he just kept repeating that they were running Starcraft 2 on one of the F series in the store, as if that's all we needed to hear to fork over $1300.\n\nWe decided to head up to the Microsoft Store to do some comparison shopping. They are very nice up there. They had the previous iteration of the F series in stock for $1000, and the specs appeared to be the same except for having 4 GB RAM compared to 6 GB on the newer model down in the Sony store.\n\nWe went back to Sony to verify what made up the $300 difference on their model, and the manager could not explain the price difference. It appears the newer one had only been redesigned, and had the aforementioned higher RAM. That's not worth $300 though. The manager referred me to another associate he referred to as \"the Vaio expert\" and drifted away. I guess he'd had enough of us and probably doesn't work on commission. I asked \"the Vaio guy\" if the newer model had faster RAM or a faster RPM hard drive, and his eyes glazed over with ignorance. He said he would Google it for me, and I watched the painful process of someone Googling when they don't actually know what they're looking for. I finally thanked him for his time and asked some follow-up questions I thought he should know: Do they offer an educator discount? He doesn't know. He thinks maybe a student discount, but he doesn't know if and how much. Are any accessories included? He doesn't know. He doesn't think so. I fish for a free laptop case or free mouse or SOMETHING, practically coming right out and saying, \"I'm giving you plenty of opportunities to sell me but you're not taking any of them, dipstick.\"\n\nNo dice. I went upstairs and bought it from the Microsoft Store. 10% educator discount, nice.

I stopped in at Phantom after being recommended by other locals. They are located on Craig right in an easy place to walk if you are in Oakland; I suspect parking might be a little tricky, but easy for bus riders.\n\nIn regards to appearance and selection, this is a nice store. It is spacious and has a great selection, and there are a lot of things to choose from. It is very well-appointed and nice.  Based on selection and appearance, I'd probably give 5 stars.\n\nUltimately, I did not become a regular customer here because of the customer service. In my first visit to the comic shop, the man behind the counter stared a hole through me as I browsed, never speaking, just leering at me with a stone face. When I said hello or smiled, a terse nod was the only response. On another visit I tried to join a comics conversation between employee and customer, and was basically rebuffed; maybe I should have minded my own business, but I'm used to being able to have chit chat with other fans in a comic shop. I'd give this about 1 star. \n\nOverall, this is a nice store that doesn't give me the service I expect.

While my BFF Lily L. was visiting from NYC, we visited Tivoli Village for an afternoon. After walking through The MarketLV, we stopped into ERA by Ciara and I was very excited that Ciara was there! We looked around at specialty makeup brands like DuWop and Lola (she's the only authorized seller of Lola cosmetics in Las Vegas!), admiring the beautiful packaging and unique selection. \n\nThen, we had some fun! Both Lily L. and I had the opportunity to try a few different types of lipsticks and shades, making sure we had colors appropriate to our skin tones. We both absolutely love the Lola Pin-Up Pout Plumping Lipstick in the color \"Sophia\" - a gorgeous red with a creamy formula that went on smoothly and felt moisturizing. It also came with a built-in mirror in the cover! I also got the DuWop Reverse Lipliner (a colorless, matte pencil that is creamy and when applied to the skin surrounding your lips, prevents feathering) and DuWop Tinted Prime Venom (a satin matte balm with sheer color that plumps and moisturizes) in the color \"Tango\" (described sheer black currant). We both left feeling so great!\n\nCiara is so knowledgeable about cosmetics and particularly these brands! I had such an amazing experience with trying new lip products! I didn't think I needed new lipstick, but now I don't know how I'm going to live without these Lola and DuWop lip products! I seriously LOVE my new lipstick (even when I'm not wearing any makeup, the lipstick completes any look with pizazz) and the tinted plumping balm is great. I bought it to wear on top of my lipstick for added color and moisture, but I've found myself wearing it solo and love it!\n\nI saw that ERA is moving to a new spot that'll have better access! That's exciting! So, if you are in need of amazing new makeup, see one of the talented artists at ERA and I hope you'll have the opportunity to meet Ciara!", "business_id": "bKXDZgXlwLJSrm5wCtkhMw", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-09-04", "type": "review"}

Michael seems like the kind of knowledgeable salesman who doesn't just want to make a sale, but wants to make a fit.\n\nWhen the install area was ready, Chris came out to the store floor, and Michael introduced me to him.  Chris carried my mini-tower to the technician area, with me in tow.  We chatted for a bit as he removed the side panel and looked inside, where he found some of my handiwork (a secondary hard drive hanging by the ribbon).  Immediately, he went into a bin and retrieved a hard drive housing, and secured my hardware.\n\nChris is a very personable guy, who enjoys making music using his computer.  He even let me check out a few of his tracks when I asked about them.\n\nMichael ordered several pizzas, so I indulged while watching masters of Ubuntu showcase the new product on two of Red Seven's floor models.

I did find a cute navy blue summer dress that ended up being 65% off, which made it an easier sell to my husband when I got back up to the room with my purchases. \n\nThe customer service was extremely lacking...after I finally was able to get someone to open a door to a dressing room, no one came to check on me or see if I needed a different size, which I did.

She was very sweet and gave me lots of compliments.

There were a lot of unsigned golf hats on our recent visit, perfect for those who would enjoy the novelty of owning a hat that belonged to the avid rocker golfer. There were many autographed shirts. $45 seemed to be the going price for anything signed. Alice is a generous and ubiquitous presence in the valley, with plenty of his autographs floating around. I'd suggest you pick up a signed shirt for your aging Alice Cooper fans/relatives in the Midwest.

(FYI, she ended up not liking her menthol in the end). \n\nSo we try a bunch of flavors and narrow it down to 3 flavors - Cantaburry Crush, Pink Spot, and Gummy Bear. The samples they use are at a nicotine 12mg when you are trying so keep that in mind. For us there is a harsher throat hit with more nicotine, but oddly the 3mg was just about the same feel when using the Pink Spot and Gummy Bear one. We got the Cantaburry Crush with zero nicotine and that was fine and smooth and both our favorites. I think they might've been a bit heavy handed with their nicotine.\n\nOne benefit of this place is that if it's not quite what you want, take the juice back and they will dial back or boost up the nicotine, add flavor, etc for free to get it to where you want it. Some places have a you mixed it, oh wellsies type policy and some will probably help you if it's that bad, but this is the first store I've been told I can do this before something goes wrong. It's SO simple, but is going the extra mile to tell a customer, please don't hesitate if it's not right. \n\nCost wise, it's a few dollars more than a few of the other custom mix juice shops but still not absolutely out of bounds. Prices break down as such 6ml $5.95, 12ml $9.95, 30ml $22.95 120ml $69.95 or 6 6ml variety pack for $29.95. Since the store is in the North and Vegas suffers from the anything not on their side of town is too far disease, you can also order everything online as well. \n\nWe also got a few tanks for these new flavors here, the ismoka mini bcc tanks. I just dont like the smoke tip compared to a round one and it has a smaller tank than most but the draw is good from them. This is probably the best carto/ bottom coil you'll find. Seriously. I prefer the mini over the larger (bit tighter draw), but both have been the most consistent ones we've found so if you're starting off this is a great affordable BCC to start with. Plus also is you can get either 2.5 or 1.8 ohm replacement coils though the default in the tank you purchase is 2.5. \n\nCustomer service here I feel is always good. We've always had someone friendly and willing to take the time with us. This visit was definitely in line with the good service we've had all previous times and we've now dealt with a handful of different people working there. \n\nIt's not my favorite juice, but their variety is wide so I will probably be back. I just know this is somewhere I prefer to get it at a zero, just for flavor than any nicotine. I feel for a beginner, it's a clean inviting friendly space and is not intimidating to come in and try a starter. For me, I've moved on to another level of things like mechanical mods and trying various juices so the store sits at a A-OK for me. One of the guys did say they were thinking of stocking more US made mechanicals and doing a few building type workshops. If they did, I feel this would be a store with much more hold on the vaping community and I would probably come here more.", "business_id": "lPONCVSGRrobKoZtZQh0Gw", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-07-18", "type": "review"}

We managed to find a spot all the way in the rear of the lot. Which is OK, I need to walk more often! So we wobbled all the way to the store. The first thing you hit is the children's play house. Yes! They have a baby sitter for you!! We decided to take the posse with us, and they were well behaved. \nSo my wife was in awe! Never seen anything like this before. Glad I was there, you can get overwhelmed with all the people, and products. Ikea has a one-way system. This is to allow you to see all of their products.\nAfter spending about three hours looking and writing down what we are interested in. We made a decision to get three wardrobe closets, but since this was a larger item that consist many other parts. We had to go down stairs to the self service area. This is were it can get frustrating! You have to find the correct aisle and bin location for each part and pull it yourself. By the time you get everything you need, get through the cashiers to pay, and then of course they have to have the snack bar right in front of the check out area! \nOverall we had a good time, glad I was able to take the wife here.

The girl who helped us was only a couple of years older than him and knew a few people that attended his high school....so he immediately felt comfortable talking to her and listening to her advice on what to pick.\n\nShe asked him questions about color, style, etc.....he looked at her like a deer in the headlights....it was hilarious.  Of course he didn't want to go with my selections because I'm the old guy who's choice of style is \"outdated\"....what?!  Whatever, I don't understand the kids nowadays and their sense of style...so I was happy to have the young girl employee assist us.  I stepped back and let them do their thing.\n\nShe showed him the options and helped him pick it....my role was to pay the bill.  After it was all said and done, the total damage was $181, which included the tuxedo, shirt, vest, tie, cufflinks, and shoes.  It's too bad Kiddo is not the same size as me, otherwise I would've bought a tuxedo instead of paying that much to rent one....and he'll probably outgrow it for his Senior Prom, so I paid the rental price instead.\n\nThe day we went to the store, there were at least a dozen other kids waiting in line behind us to get fitted for tuxedo rentals...we picked the wrong time to go but lucked out and came just after they opened, so we beat the rush by a few minutes.  They didn't rush us though and thanks to the great service of that girl, he was happy and had a good time at his first prom....memories that will last forever.\n\nReturn Factor - 95%", "business_id": "RLwo3ykwR0ZzaU95Tpp97g", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-05-22", "type": "review"}

We make our way down there.  From the outside you wouldn't expect much on the inside based upon looks, wrought iron windows, etc.\n\nAnyway, once inside they have the store broken up into different areas.  One area for acoustic guitars, one for electric, others for other instruments.  Each section has a dedicated staff member who is supposed to be an expert on the goods.  \n\nWe first stopped in the electric guitar section because my friend wasn't sure which guitar to get.  The staff member was knowledgeable about the different types of guitars and what kinds of sounds each produced.  We decided to check out the acoustic section next.\n\nAgain, same sort of service was provided by the staff there.  In the end we both ended up with acoustic guitars, with the help from the staff members who didn't exude a pretentious attitude.\n\nCheck it out if you are looking at getting either acoustic or electric guitars.", "business_id": "EqgJXAnJZ6S0dX5ULBT3Pg", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-04-11", "type": "review"}

Typical stores that you'd see in any major shopping area.. American Eagle, Journey's, Target, Old Navy, Best Buy etc.. Have a Movie theatre which I've never been in but looking a the number of people outside of it, its probably always packed.. \n\nRestaurants.. they have some decent chains and some ones I've never heard of.. Slices, Chipotle, Dave and Busters, Some steak/BBQ places and a mixture of everything else.. \n\nI've never really been there for much.. The thing I like about it is that it is good for quick shopping.. Going to a regular mall can take forever, going to Tempe Market,  If one of the shops is one you need to go to this place has so much parking and ins and outs, makes it so much easier.. \n\nSo more or less it is good for quick trips, to hang-out.. good if you are in high school or middle school..?", "business_id": "OOCLVeqqMFfSnKa7liv0Kw", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-07-12", "type": "review"}

Wow, thanks!\nI finally left when one of the clerks told me, \"you should probably check out Amazon.\"  That was the best assistnace I got at Fry's.\n\n5/15/13\nA quick update.  I went to Best Buy today, and wtihin about 15 minutes got everything I needed thanks to a floorperson who actually knew something about the merchandise and didn't just tell me I should try Amazon.
